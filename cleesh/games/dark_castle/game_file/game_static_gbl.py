	'illuminated_letters' : "First with great effort and then, surprisingly, with surety and confidence, you read out loud the text on the scroll. Your voice booms forth of its own accord - as if some part of your brain has been getting ready to say these words all your life. The rest of brain is struggling just to make sense of what you're saying with such confidence... it seems to be something along the lines of a recipe with ingredients... so if the 'heir to the true king' (whoever that might be)... reads 'this precious parchment'(you're pretty sure that means the scroll you're holding)... in the Throne Room (you've been there!)... while 'adorned with the gleaming headpiece of state and seated upon our royal cathedra' (whatever that means)... and also requiring that 'so long as the castle remains invested with a representative of our most noble heraldic charge seen ever upon our crest, seal, and glorious coat of arms' (even Ms. Lusk would have no clue what this means but she would notice that an awful lot of the Illuminated Letters in this sentence include a hedgehog with a sword and a key)... and then it finishes on a rather dramatic high note with the words 'upon the hour these conditions be met, a new King of Bright Castle shall shine forth and be proclaimed!'",
	'calligraphy' : "'The Kinging Scroll'",
    'insignia' : "Baked into the biscuit are the symbols of a key and sword. As a child you remember asking your great grandmother Nana why she stamped these onto the front of every biscuit. 'It's a reminder of the past Burty,', she declared, 'and maybe someday, even, of the future.' You were never clear what she meant - but you've loyaly used Nana's original key and sword stamp on every biscuit you've ever baked.",
	'gold_capitals' : "'GUARD GOBLIN OF THE FORTNIGHT: FOR MERITORIOUS MEMORANDUMS AND THE VIOLENT SUPPRESSION OF MINOR INFRACTIONS'",

	### ViewOnly objects ###
	'dark_castle' : "Dark Castle looms over you. Its facade of blackened turrets and cracked walls is dour and singlularly univiting. It's hard to imagine but your great grandma Nana used to tell wonderous stories of the old days when the castle gleamed brightly on its hill and was a beacon of order and goodness for the land. Maybe it's because of the stories, but you've always had a bit of an itch to venture inside. The place has somehow called to you - almost daring you to enter - and now that a round of beer and your alehouse repuation as a fearless ruffian are on the line, you intend to answer the call!",		
	'moat' : "You know Burt, you've never heard anyone say 'It's a hot out - I think I'll go for a swim in the Dark Castle Moat'... and now you know why. The dark and muddy water is repellent and it swirls in a way that makes you suspect there's something down there you'd rather not meet.",
	'alcove' : "A small indentation in the west wall near the Iron Portcullis. It is just deep enough to hold a Guard Goblin and a mysterious apperatus.",
	'faded_tapestries' : "The Main Hall Faded Tapestries are vast and elaborate, covering both the east and the west walls. They appear to depict an unkempt figure breaking into a solitary white house and from there pillaging a Great Underground Empire. Strangely, there is a looming figure near the top of the west tapestry who appears to be tapping with his fingers on a many-buttoned plank and staring intently into a window filled with text. For some reason the figure disconcerts you.. his presence in the Faded Tapestries fills you with existential dread and forces you to question your agency and the very nature of your being... BURT!! Get hold of yourself man! You're a mangey, pub-crawling adventurer who lives in his mom's basement. You don't even know what half those words mean. Stop staring at tapestries and get out there and find the treasure you fool!!",
	'stone_coffer' : "This is the sort of coffer that, in better days, was no doubt filled to the brim will brightly shining gold pieces. Unfortunately, as you'd begun to fear, those days are long past and now the coffer is filled only with a deep layer of dust.",
    'family_tree' : "It appears to show the family tree of the Flathead dynasty. Though generally agreed to have peaked (nadired?) during the reign of Dimwit Flathead and petered out shortly there-after during the inglorious and flacid rulership of Wurb Flathead, this Family Tree tells a different story. It claims that an illigitimate child of Wurb, secreted away kept in hiding during the Empire's fall, continued the line for another generation from whence arose William 'The Wanderer' Flathead only a little over 100 years ago. The area below William is indistinct and feels incomplete.. as if there are details still waiting to be filled in.\n\nAt the very top of the Family Tree you see a royal crest. Oddly enough, it appears to be a Hedgehog bearing a Shiny Sword and a Silver Key. To your astonishment, the insignia looks familiar! The sword and the key - their shape, proportions, and positioning - look exactly the same as decorative insignia on the biscuits your great grandmother Nana taught you to bake as a child. The resemblance is uncanny!",
    
	'dead_goblin' : "Even in its demise, the Dead Goblin looks fierce and resolute. Whoever dispatched this enemy must be an adventurer of some renown!",
	
	### item objects ###
	'rusty_key' : "An old Rusty Key... the one you swore to the whole pub (and miss Chrissy Brewer!) that you'd use to pillage the Dark Castle... What could you possibly do with it?",
	'shiny_sword' : "This is an elven sword of great antiquity. The Shiny Sword glitters even in the dim light. Despite its age, the edge is keen and looks ready for action. There are Elven Runes engraved upon the blade.",
	'torn_note' : "This must have dropped from the Goblin's hand when you slew it. The Torn Note is ragged and only barely readable.", 
	'grimy_axe' : "A nasty looking weapon - and poorly maintained too. If you ever get out of this castle you should set aside some time to polish it. You notice uppon inspection that there is some Small Printing on the handle.",
	'silver_key' : "The small silver_key glitters in the dim light. It certainly stands out in the otherwise dreary Dark Castle. If you find a glittering silver keyhole somewhere this is definitely the key for it!",
	'kinging_scroll' : "Wow this thing is fancy! Huge letters with little pictures inside them and all sorts of curvy flourish at the end of each and every letter. Burt, your humble biscuit-baking, pub-crawling brain doesn't even know what to call this thing but if it did you would call it an illuminated manuscript composed (of course) of Illuminated Letters. Thanks to the hard and thankless work of your first grade teacher, Ms. Lusk, you could probably just manage to read the Illuminated Letters.",

	### food objects ###
	'cheese_wedge' : "A small wedge of cheese you absconded with from the larder. It's very small - so small that a lone mouse could probably make off with the whole thing - but your mother was saving it for company so you suspect it's quite delicious.",
	'baked_biscuit' : "Every time you look at one of these biscuits you think of your great grandmother Nana, who raised you and taught you how to bake. This Baked Biscuit in particular came fresh out of the oven just this morning. You ate the rest of the batch on the hike over to Dark Castle and this last biscuits is all that's left. It smells mouth-wateringly delicious. There is an Insignia imprinted on the Baked Biscuit.",

	### liquid objects ###
	'well_water' : "After your trudge up the hill to Dark Castle the Well Water looks invitingly refreshing.",

	### clothes objects ###
	'royal_crown' : "Giant rubies: check. Dozens of glittering jewels: check. Gleaming gold and precious metals: check. Yep, this is a *seriously royal* crown you've got here Burt!",
	'hedgehog_broach' : "The silver Hedgehog Broach is about an inch in diameter and is carved with the crest of a hedgehog bearing a sword and a key. It's strangely familiar... you've seen one just like it... long ago... examining the Hedgehog Broach up close triggers a long forgotten memory...\n\nyou were only nine years old... it was the evening of the Spring Festival but you and all your family were gathered inside, at the bedside of your great grandmother, Nana Baker. She was old - very, very old - so old no even was sure how old - not even Nana. She'd been unable to eat or get out of bed for the past week and the village healer had given his solemn verdict that at long last her time had come. The whole village had come round to pay their last respects but now it was just family left. She looked very tired and her eyes were closed.\n\n'Billy', said Nana, meaning your father, 'I'm weary... be a good lad and go heat me some tea... Nice and hot please.'. Next she sent your aunt off for a special pillow she'd loaned to a friend. Soon every member of the family was off on an errand and it was just you and Nana.\n\nQuite suddenly, Nana's eyes opened, bright blue and wide awake. 'Well, Burty, finally we can have a little chat. I wish you were a bit older but now will have to do. Tell me Burty, how did ya feel about copying lines?'\n\n'It wasn' so bad' you'd stammered back.\n\nNana laughed and gave you a warm smile. 'Don't feel bad Burty, I wasn't much of a Coppiest myself - I was born a Baker and had a bit of a rebellious streak in me - just like you. You remind me so much of my Willy... and that's not entirely an accident mind you. Thought I might see a resemblance in your grandfather or father but they were mindful lads and happy enough to be Coppiests. I guess it's waited for you to show itself. Probably just as well.'\n\n'Ah Willy... now don't get me wrong, Papa Coppiest was a good man - hard working and with a kind heart - took me hand when many others wouldn't have and always treated me kind. But you're from different stock Burty, very different. And that comes with some responsibilities... you've got a destiny 'afore you and that can be hard on young man with no expecting of it. That's why I'm telling you this now.'\n\n'Your real great grandpa was Willy... William Herbert... last of the line of Flatheads... or so everyone's been told. He was a handsome man... like you Burty. And, unlike the rest of his family - full of romance and laughter and travel and adventure. Could be a bit reckless at times but he had a good heart. He proposed to me right proper he did... didn't really have to... he was so high up in society... and so much older too... but the moment I told him he dropped right to one knee and popped the question. Didn't care the least what people said! Swore we'd elope if the high priest wouldn't marry us... and he would have too!'\n\n'Alas, that crazy man... four months before the big day he was wandering about the castle entrance, wearing his bathrobe and Royal Crown, smoking his pipe and reading a book as he walked, as usual, and boom, he trips on the drawbridge and falls right into the Moat! Eaten right up in one big bite by one of those mean old crocodiles that have swum in it forever. Oh the day I heard the news...' And with these words she touched the Hedgehog Broach she always wore over her heart. 'It was a dark day Burty, a dark day for me an' for the castle and all the lands around.'\n\n'Someday Burty William Baker, someday you'll be King. And when you is, you be a good King... a kind and courageous and bold king... and when you is King don't ya be going walking off the edge of the drawbridge with no weapon in your hands and breaking young girl's hearts - you hear me?'\n\nStunned by this strange tale you began to stammer an answer but just then your Father returned with the hot tea. With a wink just for you, Nana's eyes closed again and she sank back into the bed. Minutes later she was gone.\n\n    For years and years you wondered what she was talking about and eventually you began to doubt the conversation had ever even happened. Over time and surpressed by grief, it had faded completely... but here in Dark Castle, with the Hedgehog Broach before you, the memory is clear and real. Nana was buried with her beloved broach - she had insisted on it. This must have been a matching mate - presumably worn by Willy himself.",
	'red_bandana' : "The ragged red bandana simultaneously projects juanty air of fluffy dog at the park - and also the rugged look of an 80s-era martial arts master ready for their final showdown.",
	'big_medal' : "This is the biggest, most-highly-polished medal you have ever seen.",

	### container objects ###
	'crystal_box' : "Atop an ornate pedestal to the left of the throne sits an intricate Crystal Box. The crystal panels are heavily leaded and skillfully carved such that you're unable to tell what may lie within. There is a silver keyhole on the front of the Crystal Box that glitters brilliantly - much like the shiny_sword in fact - in the otherwise dark and brooding room. The top of the Crystal Box is engraved with Calligraphy.",

	### surface objects ###
	'wooden_shelf' : "The Wooden Shelf looks sturdy and reliable - like it would be a good, safe place to store your stuff.",

	### PortableLiquidContainer objects ###
	'earthen_jug' : "An old Earthen Jug. According to your Nana, it once belonged to a shifty wizardy fellow who showed up in town and started prying into everyone's cupboards and asking folks if they'd seen any 'loose scrolls'. Nana ran him off with a bread paddle and he scampered so fast he dropped his water jug.", #  For ages it gave off a faint glow and your mum wouldn't have it in the house. You snagged it from the shed for this little adventure. Alas, it no longer appears to glow.
	'paper_bag' : "A smartly-creased paper bag. The wonderful smell of fresh-baked biscuts still wafts from it and you wonder if there might be any left?",

	### door objects ###
	'front_gate' : "The Front Gate is just north of the Dark Castle's drawbridge. It is 10 feet tall and reenforced with steel bands. Imposing indeed! There is Rusty Lettering across the top of the gate and a rusty keyhole next to a handle.",
	'iron_portcullis' : "Beyond the iron portcullis you can dimly make out the next room.",

	### creatures ###
	
	## guard_goblin ##
	'guard_goblin' : "The Guard Goblin peers at you with malace from the north end of the room. It stands in the Alcove guarding a mysterious aperatus of some sort. It wears a crisply ironed uniform and gives off an air of hauty, even vicious, Officiousness. The Guard Goblin is armed and dangerous and clearly takes its guard duties very seriously. It would not be wise to approach the Iron Portcullis or the Alcove (or the Guard Goblin!) un-armed.",

	# feature_lst #
	'chewed_fingernails' : "Despite its officious demeanor and starched uniform, the Guard Goblin clearly has a terrible fingernail chewing habit. Its nailes are sharp, ragged, and icky!",
	'officiousness' : "It should be emphasized that the sort of officiousness that the Guard Goblin displays is not of the kind that involves being overly helpful. Rather, it is the sort of officiousness that is assertive of authority in an annoyingly domineering way, especially with regard to petty or trivial rules and regulations. \n\nIt is said that a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds - and the Guard Goblin wears its astringent officiousness like a shiny badge of honor. It scrutinizes you with a displeased frown of disaproval and a captious shake of the head. At any moment the Guard Goblin looks likely to ask you whether you've recieved the memo about the new cover sheet for the Treaspassing Permit Suspension reports.",

	## royal_hedgehog ##
	'hungry_hedgehog' : "This poor little Royal Hedgehog has seen better days. It looks gaunt and like it skipped breakfast - and maybe lunch and dinner too. But despite a somewhat bedraggled appearance, the Royal Hedgehog has an air of fierce Loyalty about it. It may be in need of a good meal, but the Royal Hedgehog's eyes shine with the bright gleam of devoted guardian. It also appears to have quite a preference for shiny things. You don't know why but you feel an innate fondness for this small but faithful creature.",
	# feature_lst # 
	'fierce_teeth' : "The Royal Hedgehog has huge incisors that could tear a... well wait, that's just not true... the Royal Hedgehog, being of the mamilian Erinaceinae family, has small flat teeth like every other hedgehog. But he has such a good natured look to him that it's quite startling to see him roused!",
	'loyalty' : "At a glance, it's apparent that the Royal Hedgehog is a loyal creature. It exudes a fierce, if slightly scruffy, allegiance. Not the grasping, starched-suit adherence of the sycophant but the slightly frowzy fidelity of a faithful and dependable mut.",


	# burt #
    
	'burt_0' : "You cast an apraising inner eye and take stock: Manly rough-and-tumble good looks - check, Affable demeanor paired with self-depreciating humor - check!, A lifetime of finely-honed baking skills - check!! Yep - that's you Burt - A fine specimen of a man. If not for the belching, farting, and cussing I don't know how you'd ever manage to fend off the ladies!",

	'burt_1' : "'Well Burty, let's take a look at you.' - that's what your great grandmother, Nana, who raised you until you were nine, would say. And Nana always found the good side of what she saw. When you didn't like the coppiest work you were born to she taught you to bake. When you couldn't sit still she put you to work doing chores for your elderly neighbors. When people whispered that you were a bit odd, Nana hugged you close and called you special. It's been 13 years since Nana left this earth - you wonder what she wouold see in you now?",

	'burt_2' : "You pause and ponder for a moment - what on earth are you doing here in the gloom of Dark Castle? To be honest, your life has been a bit short on purpose lately. Baking's a fine profession, but you can only bake so many batches of biscuits before you start wondering what it's all about... so maybe Dark Castle is something bigger? And then there's Chrissy Brewer - the prettiest miss in town - she seemed mighty impressed when you declared you'd march in here - and who wouldn't want her attention? In your head you hear your friend Cecily's voice: 'Burt, your just chansing after shiny baubles' - and she's probably right - but something about this place calls to you - to do *something* - but what?",

	'burt_3' : "You take an introspective inventory of self: What are your hopes and aspirations beyond the next night of carousing at the pub and possibly, someday, a kiss from Chrissy Brewer? It's like hollering into a well - nothing comes back but the question itself. Most of the lads at the pub don't seem to be asking fool questions like this - or if they are, their answer is as simple as 'Find a lass that'l have you and start a family'. You're looking for a... 'destiny' seems too big... but something more than the next batch of biscuits... You wish Cecily were here... she's the one person in town who knows you well enough to tell you what you're thinking... even if she does make fun of you for having a crush on her sister every chance she gets.",

	'burt_4' : "'Take a moment to contemplate your condition.' you hear your Father say. He was a big fan of self examination - still is you suspect - though you haven't had a propper sit down with him for ages. He's getting on - word is he might even retire soon - you should make the time - but it's always awkward. He's never quite forgiven you for not following him in the Coppiest trade. After six girls he'd given up on having a son to carry on the name - and then, you'd arrived and he'd been sure you'd become the famly's first scribe. But no, you were just awful at it. Always trying to write with your left hand. Couldn't spell. And what you wrote was inveitably illegible... and of course you hated it to boot... ran off from the copy chamber the first moment you could no matter what you were told. Broke Pa's heart. Nana understood - she said you were born for different things. She taught you to bake and was the mother you never had... but you wish there was something you could do to make Pa proud. Who knows - Maybe that's partly why you're here, wandering around the ruins of Dark Castle - trying to do something worth doing?",

	'brass_lantern' : "Your trusty, battered-but-still-working light source. It's been in your household for ages; the family furphy is that your great grandmother, Nana, seized it from a maurauding 'adventurer' ages ago after giving him what-for with a broom. You sure wouldn't want your light source to go out - Dark Castle must be home to hundreds of Grues!", # eleiminate battery-powered

	'main_hall' : "You are in what was once the sumptuous main hall of the castle. Faded Tapestries hang on the east and west walls. The Front Gate is to the south. And a foreboding archway leads to the north.",

	'antechamber' :"You are in a what feels more like a wide, tall-ceilinged corridor than a room. Apparently this is the room-before-the-room, the pre-room before the really, really grand room that comes after it. If so, the next room must be quite something because, back in it's day, this spot was clearly impressive. Alas, like all of the castle, it has fallen on dark times and now feels more sinister than grand. The east and west walls are bare stone. To the south is an open passageway leading to the Main Hall and to the north there is an Iron Portcullis that guards the path to the grand chamber beyond. Near the Iron Portcullis on the west wall there is a small Alcove. It appears to have some kind of apperatus in it but you can't see it very well due to the dim light and the Guard Goblin standing in front of it and glowering at you. The whole north end of the room is cloaked in shadows that make you uneasy.",

	'throne_room' : "The room you're currently in is vast - almost cavernous. At the far end sits what must have once been a grand and glorious Throne. To the right of the Throne is a giant Stone Coffer and to the left an elegant pedestal that holds what appears to be a delicate Crystal Box. On either wall there are tall windows - now shattered, ruined, and completely choked with thorned vines - but you you remember hearing stories from your great grandmother, Nana, of the beautiful, glowing stained glass that once filled them. And above the room's entrance hangs a vast (though quite dusty) Family Tree.",

'Charity and kindness are the secrect ingredients Burty' she would say. And she meant it.

	'read_bkstry_str' : "An aged scroll of parchment - much of the ink upon it long dried but some of it quite fresh - appears before you. It is entitled 'The Future and Once King of Bright Castle'.",
    
	'backstory' : "\nThe Last of the Flatheads:\n\nHerbert was the the secret and illigitamate heir of the Flathead dynasty. The result of a short-lived affair between Wurb Flathead (commonly considered to be the last of the Flatheads - and known for litteraly nothing else), and a young scullery maid named Thessaly.\n\nThessaly wasn't your typical maid - she was a self taught street mage from the wrong side of the Frigid River and her main goal in working for the Great Underground Empire court was to get access to its grand library. Her interest in Wurb could be best be described as 'lurid facination' (he had this effect on many) and certainly was nothing along the lines of true love. It took little time for Wurb's gaze to wander and she was releived when it did.\n\nThessaly left the palace as soon as she realized that she was with child. She had no desire to be caught up in the court's political machinations and, frankly, things weren't looking good. She could see that the long-celebrated excesses of the royal line were finally about to catch up to them. In the event, Thessaly's insight was keen - the Great Underground Empire fell less than a year later.\n\nBy this time, Thessaly had settled in a scrappy little village in the hinterlands, far from the immediate blast radius of the Empire's fall. Here, she raised newborn Herbert, intentionally named as differently from Wurb as possible. Her own name would never appear on the roles of the illustrius Circle of Enchanters - and she likely wouldn't have had the patience for the guilds even if they'd have had her - but she had learned enough from her late night excursions to the royal library to concoct working healing and love potions (and a couple of nasty poisons she made a point of not talking about) - and that was enough to earn her a comfortable, if idosyncratic, living in a backwoods village.\n\nHerbert lived a quiet, if slightly odd life as the only son of the village herbalist. No portents of destiny wafted about him and, if asked, his mother, Thessaly, stated flatly that the less said about Herbert's father the better. Little is known about Herbert's early existence but he did eventually meet and marry a young lady, Clara, the warior woman of the village. It's hard to imagine what Clara, said to be boistorous, fearless, and a bit crude, saw in the introverted Herbert but perhaps this is a case where opposites really did attract. Sadly, Clara passed only two years after their union from wounds incurred from successfully defending the village from a goblin raid (even Thessaly's potions were not enough to save her). Worse yet, Thessaly herself died just a year later from the disasterous results of an unwise potions experiment (fortunately, she did all her potion-craft in a remote shed so there were no other casualties from the detonation) - leaving Herbert to raise young William on his own.\n\nYoung William Herbert Flathead (who would come to be known as 'Willie the Wanderer') had no trade to follow in and little if any actual parenting. In fact, if the tales are to be believed, he grew up practically ferral. Certainly he was a child of mighty contrasts.  He was a robust and vigorous lad who roamed the surrounding forest fearlessly from a young age, more often than not returning home with a tale of adventure and a goblin head to prove it. And yet, he had a natural bent towards his father's bookishness. As he grew into manhood is was said of Willie that if you needed to find him urgently you should either start by searching the darkest caves of the northern frontier or else begin with the quiet reading room of the royal archives. And then there was his grandparent's influence... Willie had a knack for minor magic and was known to dabble in potions in a hobbiest way. He was also immune to the influences of power and prestiege - as much at ease in the halls of the high court as he was on the rocky trail.\n\nSocially, Willie was an open book. He had a natural love for his fellow man, woman, dwarf, and elf - regardless of station - and embraced all he met with candor and the expectation of goodness. Accordingly, he struggled to comprehend the petty follies and vanities of those around him and often, unintentionally, ran roughshod over their insecurities. These traits endeared him to the populace - but were perhaps also the seeds of his downfall. Willie was born for greatness - but the world was not born for Willie.\n\nWillie's Reign:\n\nWillie arrived at 'High Castle' at the age of 30, soon after gaining the Twenty Treasures of Zork - and with them, great wealth and renown. At the time, High Castle was an outpost of the GUE and had been under stewardship ever since the empire's fall 65 years earlier. The Steward, the eldest son of High Castle's first steward and equal measures entitled and insecure in his reign, would doubtless have been intimidated by Willie's prowers and fame alone. But when Willie visited the castle courtyard - with the withered tree and waterless fountain - both destined to be barren until the return of the Flathead line - the Fountain errupted in a gyzer of water and the Tree burst forth in leaf and fruit. Thus Willie's heritage was revealed and (to his great surprise) he was proclaimed King on the spot by the acclimation of the populace. The Steward could only look on, stripped of his station, glowering with impotent rage and envy. And while the people loved Willie from the start, the Steward was not alone in his displeasure. The High Priest was also in a state of silent, vindictive furry.\n\nWillie was an open-hearted man of the people. He came from the village streets himself and felt a bond with the less fortunate. He saw that the Steward's taxes - and the High Priets tithes - on the poor were far too high - and that the nobility were nearly untaxed. Uncaring of the impact on himself (he was likely the richest man of the land at the time) he rewrote the tax code to shift the burden. He was also a huge believer in education and the notion that any man - or woman - could 'pull themselves up by thar bootstraps'. He noted that the treasury was already healthy (though not as healthy as it should have been given the tax rates) and spent liberally to provide education and opportunity for all. He was also a fair handed man by nature and thus put a stop to curruption wherever he came across it. Perhaps most distressing to the Steward and the High Priest, Willie was not just a man of the people - he was a man of *all* people. He renamed 'High Castle' to 'Bright Castle' and threw open the gates to all. He embraced Elven minstrals and Dwarven craftsmen alike as full citizens and supported the arts generously. It was the golden era of Bright Castle. There was music and joy in the streets and it was said that every day felt like festival day. And yet, like so many golden ages, it was to last just a briefly.\n\nWillie was at least mildly aware that he was up-ending the order of things and therefore likely upsetting the previous standard bearers. He did his best to maintain at least civil relations with the Steward (who he made the new Sherif) and the High Priest (with whom he shared power as best he could under the notion of separation of church and state) - but to no avail. In truth, he - and the kingdom - might have been better off had Willie simply thrown them both in the dungeons - but then he likely could not have been the beacon of light that he was had that been his practice.\n\nThe Steward and High Priest were deeply offended by Willie's liberal ways and incensed that their own powers had been circumscribed. But beyond policy and ideology, for both men, it was personal. The Steward, a vain and small minded man who, even when in power, had been defensive of his position and accutely sensitive to any slight, would be forever vengeful for his loss of office. In taut whispered tones he spoke of Willie as a fraudulent usurper to those he trusted. And the High Priest had his own dark reasons for wrath. For some years he'd had his letcherous eye on the beautiful young baker who sang so sweetly, in such pure notes, in the church choir. But she was wilful and stuborn and swore that no man would rule her. The High Priest searched daily for a means of entrapment but under Willie's rule, his means were limited. Three years into Willie's rule, the king and baker met by chance and it became clear to all that they were meant for each other. Less than a year later, Willie informed the High Priest that, in total disregard of church tradition, he planned to wed her publically. The High Priest's jealousy knew no bounds. Secretly, nightly, the he and the Steward prayed at the church's alter for Willie's demise.\n\nWillie and Nana's Courtship:\n\nDepsite their considerable age gap, Willie and Nana, known then as Miss Tiffany Baker, were simply made for each other. He was decisive, gruff, open-hearted, and pragmatic. She was kind, idealistic, empathic, and, fearless. Where Willie made right by the sword, Nana made right through her baking. They met at the Spring Festival which happened to also be Nana's 21st birthday. What started as good natured bartering over the price of baked goods (where Willie was immediately taken to meet the only stallkeeper willing to demand full price from the King) quickly became a wide-ranging, evening-long discussion on favorite books, economic policy, and the correct way in which to eat jumble crab pie (Nana was incredulous that Willie would use a new-fangled fork rather than a spoon). Their first conversation was, for the most part, an extended debate. Anyone watching (and many were) would have anticipated the evening ending with either Willie being slapped or Nana being tossed into the dungeons. But in truth, each of them came away from the night intrigued - they were both forces of nature who had not before then met their match.\n\nWillie tracked down Nana's baking shop the next day. He claimed to have developed an addiction to her biscuits (which were, indeed, renowned throughout the land) but also declared that he wanted to clarify a few of his points of difference from the the night before... and so the conversation continued. What began as mutual curiousity soon turned into mutual enchantment and before long into a deep and abiding love. Willie, who had intended to depart birthright Castle within a year, suddenly found himself ready to settle down if Bright Castle was where Nana was. And Nana, who had never included a man in any of her life plans, found that she was ready to reshape those plans to make room for Willie.\n\nSome months later, Nana came to Willie's chambers and told him in a fierce but vulnerable voice, that she was pregnant and prepared to depart Bright Castle and make her way in the outlands, annonymously and on her own. Instead, he burst into tears of joy, embraced her, and then dropped to one knee to propose marriage. Shyly, and with tears of her own, she accpeted. Willie announced the engagement publically the very next morning (not thinking to mention it to the High Priest till several days later) and the kingdom celebrated the news with joy. In truth, Willie and Nana were the last to learn that they were to be wed - the rest of the land had already known for some time.\n\nKrill's Evil Plans:\n\nAlas, Willie's reign - and the happiness of Nana and all the land - was cut tragically short by a random accident involving a mis-step off the drawbridge while unarmed (Willie had been meaning to see about the moat crocodiles but had never gotten around to it). Ever since, there have been attempts to attribute his death to foul play but none of these theories has ever stood up to scrutiny. By all appearances, he simply, regretably, slipped.\n\nBut while Willie's death itself may have been a genuine accident, what followed in its wake was evil of the first degree. The Steward and High Priest were delighted by Willie's demise. At long last, their nightly prayers were answered and they were freed from Willie's 'tyrany'. Surely, if left to their own devices, they would have returned to their old ways and likely thought up a few new petty injustices to boot. But things were to take a dark turn. The very night of Willie's death, as the Steward and the High Priest were drinking brandy and cackling over thier good fortune at the alter of the empty chappel, the dark warlock Krill himself appeared before them - radiating with power and might - and blocking their path to the chappel's double doors. The Steward and High Priest were terrified. They scanned the room frantically for means of escape or a hiding spot. To their amazement, Krill meekly knelt before them, and with open arms and humble tones implored them 'Your magesties, I come to beseach of you a boon.' At this time, Krill was still young and handsome of appearance and spoke with an echoing voice that was hard to say no to. It is doubtful that mere mortals such as the Steward and High Priest could have denied his wishes had they tried - but the test was not made. Krill had only to stroke their bruised egos and without hesitation they readily acquiesced.\n\nThen it was that Krill unfolded a plan of deepest darkness to the weak and wretched mortals. He suggested clever means by which their heart's desires could be theirs. And in return, he asked only that they conduct 'a small and simple ritual' - which he promised would assure them of the respect and position they were rightly due. The passage of history would prove this moment to be Krill's undoing. He was not yet at full strength and was unwise to unviel his presence to the Circle so soon - yet the power vacuum presented an unexpected opportunity. Bright Castle stood well distant from the remote castle of Lonely Mountain where Krill had begun to amass his forces. If he could corrupt Bright Castle and make it a second seat of power, he could assult the Circle on two fronts - and perhaps smash through their defenses before they knew he was upon them. Krill, never one to doubt his own cleverness, gave in to the temptation. But though his gamble would prove to be his folly, so to was it to be the ruin of Bright Castle. The Steward and High Priest never thought twice about granting Krill's requests. They thanked him profusely for his wise and cunning counsil and followed his instructions to the letter.\n\nThe next day the Steward announced publically that he had incontrovertable evidence that Nana was Willie's assasin. He re-siezed his full Steward powers and declared martial law. His first action was to have Nana, still dressed in black and in deep mourning, thrown into the dungeons - with a trial to follow 'when time and prudence allowed'. His second action was to have Bright Castle renamed back to it's 'proper and respected' title of High Castle. Last but not least, he sent a speedy messenger to his nearest neighbor and sought an immediate bond of marriage with their youngest daughter - the Princess Saffron - known to be sickly in her youth and little seen since - but said now to be both beautiful and obedient. The missive was blunt - the Steward was pursuing High Castle's interests first and was placing a premium on loyalty. Send the Princess or expect a seige. The little nation had hitherto looked on Bright Castle as an ally and a  protector. They had no means to resist assult - and so rather than have her ripped from the castle by force of arms, they submitted and sent the Princess Saffron speedily back with the messenger that very same day.\n\nLater on that eventful day, the High Priest, seated on the chappel throne, dressed in his most radient robes, and clutching his bejeweled golden scepter, had Nana brough before him upon her knees. He told her that he had an understanding with the Steward and was willing to open his heart and absolve her of her many sins if she would swear a life-long vow of service to the church and willingly perform regular acts of penance to his satisfaction. Here the narrative takes a turn. Exactly what followed is uncertain but the High Priest seems to have miscalculated. Perhaps he was a somewhat too smug. Perhpas he was naive in having Nana's shackles removed and the guards dismissed. All that is known for sure is that Nana did not join the oder and the guards standing at the door were wholly unprepared to halt the lithe figure that lept through the chappel's stained glass window. And in any case, they were far too busy rushing to the aid of the High Priest who was bent double and yelping, whimpering, and cursing in a most un-priestly fashion regarding exactly where and how hard he'd been struck by the golden scepter.\n\nA Summoning Gone Wrong and the Fall of Bright Castle:\n\nKrill's intentions are well understood. He sought to Summon a deamon and sacrifice Princess Saffron to it as part of a dark bargain to secretly convert Bright Castle into his second seat of his power. This did indeed nearly came to pass - the demon was summoned - and Princess Saffron vanished completely, never to be seen or heard from again - but somewhere along the way, Krill's plan went dreadfully awry.\n\nFor reasons unknown, the ritual was disruptied, the bargain was not sealed, and the demon was forced to return from whence it came. But in its brief moment on this plane - furious at the promise that was made but not kept - the demon spat out a horrible spell: it cursed all in Bright Castle to have their darkest traits revealed in their very being for ever after.\n\nThankfully, the vast majority of the castle's inhabitants were out of the castle at the time assisting in puting out a barn fire. But those that remained, the Steward, the High Priest, and a number of others, were transformed into monsterous countanences of thier worst natures. It is said that Krill himself, who had been leading the ritual, was the most horribly transformed - his previously handsome features turned hideous - his skin made orange and his hair turned unnatural and wretched to look upon. The very castle itself was corrupted and took on a grim and foreboding aspect. All who could fled Dark Castle's shadow and settled in the small village nestled behind a hill and across a stream some miles away.\n\nTragic though it was, the demise of Dark Castle was to be the salvation of the surrounding lands. By means still not fully understood, Enchantress Tabitha was made immediately aware of Krill's attempted summoning. Tabitha was  one of the leading lights of the Circle of Enchanters and, according to some, the true force behind Belboz's long and illustrious legacy. Within the hour of Dark Castle's fall she summoned the Circle to annunce Krill's return and his evil intentions. Belboz himself has long been credited with the unconventional (though in hindsight, brilliant) plan to send a little-known novice to conforont Krill within the dark warlock's Lonely Mountain castle. Yet a number of those present on that day privately attest that it was Tabitha who, citing an ancient and little-known prophesy, proposed this plan and then, on the spot, chose and called forth the humble novice. Whomever the driving force within the Circle may have been, the strategem worked perfectly and the Krill was routed in full.\n\nIt is also, perhaps, notable that Enchantress Tabitha ever after took a keen interest in the revival of Dark Castle. Indeed, it is beleived that after years of research she had finally found a way to lift the curse and was, in fact, on the verge of doing so when the tumultuous events of the Spellbreaker saga came to pass and the era of magic - and mgaic itself - was ended. Defeated, in her intentions, with what power remained to her, the great Enchantress made one last prophesy: that someday a scion of Willie the Wanderer would rise and free Dark Castle from the curse, whence Bright Castle would again shine forth as a beacon of goodness across the land.\n\nNana's Flight and the Legacy of Dark Castle:\n\nThe demon's curse was of such power that it's coming was visible to all. The sky went black and roiled. The heavens rumbled. And then forks of lightening barelled down from the heavens - striking the chappel steeple and the brilliant stained glass windows of the the castle's once-glorious throne room.\n\nAll present threw themselves to the ground in terror. And when the sky had ceased to roil (for it would never again fully cleared right above Dark Castle) the castle's very stones had blackened - as if coated in soot - and the vile smell of brimstone wafted from the once-welcoming front gate.\n\nThe populace stared in mute, stunned horror. Willie's death just the day before had been a mighty blow to many - but it had at least been a comprehenible loss - and after words of grief, talk turned to how the kingdom would move on. These events were beyond ken, past common understanding. For a time the populace simply stood rooted - awaiting the next blow to finish them all.\n\nSomehow, despite the loss of Willie just the day before, Nana was the first to recover. In the moments after the curse she seemed to have aged at least a decade. As if she had heard the events foretold, she beheld the scene of destruction before her and knew what needed to be done to sustain the people and the land. And though she herself never spoke of that day again, it was said in later years that that was the day Nana 'got wise'.\n\n There in the afterglow of the just extinguished barn, she turned to Thomas the Coppiest besides her - who was still holding a full bucket of water and staring open-mouthed at the chappel's cracked steeple - and said 'Mr. Coppiest, I don't love ya but I like ya - and if you'll have me, I'll be yours. And together we'll find a way to make a life.'She spoke softly and earnestly, for Thomas' ears alone, but the murmor of her voice broke the oppresive silence and slowly the towns folk regained themselves.\n\nThomas was a widower in his early fifties - an advanced age back then for those neither royal or holy. Since Nana's late teen years he'd often had a shy glance and a kind word for her - but not such as to give alarm.  He was not the sullen, angry sort that stalked his obsesions with lust and dreams of owning them. Rather, he was an open book - inescablably aware of young Nana's spirit and beauty - and also self-aware of and half-amused by his own happless doting. He was able to enjoy his time in her presence without seeking to rule it.\n\nHearing Nans's words, Thomas came to his senses, closed his mouth, put down his bucket, took her hand, and dropped to one knee. 'I would have ye, Miss Baker, and I count myself a lucky man. I'll do all I can to treat ya right and make our days sunny and long.' And so their lives were joined. Nana smiled, pulled him to his feet, kissed him gently, and said 'Then let's go make us all a life.'\n\nAnd so they did. It was Nana, with Thomas in tow, who gathered up the leading craftsmen of the village - the miller, the blacksmith, the weaver, and others - and exhorted them all to get marching to the nearby village before night fell. Her voice was kind but firm and one by one they came to grips with their new existence and rallied their fellow townsfolk to pick up what they could carry and march towards a new future.\n\nFor Nana it was not to be the life she had imagined - but it was not a bad life either - as she would often say herself. For one thing, Nana's talents were in great demand as there was a mighty need for baking in the newly, much expanded village. Thomas, for his part, was not just a good man, but a good partner too. He often minded the ovens through the night (baking being more needed in those early days than coppying) and learned the trade as best he could. In turn, Nana set to schooling on the strange art of coppying. This was her first time being exposed to reading - real reading of words bigger than four letters and writ longer than a cryer's plank - and she took to it like a bee to a bloom. There were still many then not fond of seeing a woman with a page but Thomas took delight in her love of words, taught her all he could, and brought to her a steady stream of text from anywhere he could lay hold of it.\n\nSoon enough, Nana became the note taker at the weekly town council. And though she had no official voice of her own in the meeting, she understood that the pen-holder wields a mighty power of their own. The history she took down was generally the wisest version of what had been said in the room and she often steered the ship of state: 'Now I'm sorry your honors - everyone was speaking at once and Mr. Blacksmith was a banging on the meeting table and I couldn't quite get it all - now what exactly was it that Mr. Weaver was saying before it got so loud?'. Initially, some of those in the meeting - especially those gifted with with booming voices - were dour about Nana's 'interfeering ways'... but the meetings did go a great deal more smoothly with her taking notes... and also, Nana always brought a plate of her famous biscuits - and no one could gainsay those. Soon enough, the council found excuses to not meet whenever Nana was sick our absent with child. After a generation, it was simply called 'Town Meeting with Nana' and it was assumed she'd run it from the start. And so, not from a grand hall as she had once imagined, but in a humble thatch village, word-by-word, biscuit-by-biscuit, Nana led the town to a brighter future.\n\nTime Passes:\n\nBusy as those early times were, Nana looked for signs of Willie in her firstborn, Liam (named, she swore, after a beloved uncle) but none were to be found. Liam was a cheerful and helpful tyke who learned his letters early and was happy to spend all day in the coppiest chamber mixing and refilling ink pots with his father. Despite Thomas' age, Nana bore him three children, all girls who were apt and pretty and made good matches for themselves in the now growing village.\n\nLiam eventually married his childhood sweetheart, Anna, and soon they too started a family. Thomas lived just long enough to see the first of his grandchildren arrive and died with love in his heart and gratitude for the life he'd been given. Nana, though burdened with grief (over time Nana had come to care deeply for Thomas and his gentle, kind ways) kept a watchfull eye on her grandchildren for any signs of Willie's temperment but to no avail. She adored them all but but it was a family of six young coppiests - all of them girls - who also did quite well for themselves - four marrying well and two teaming up to start their own coppiest shop in the village - the first woman owned and run shop in town. Then late in life, later than anyone expected, a seventh child arrived, a boy. He too seemed a born coppiest but again, for the sake of her 'uncle' Nana gently put her finger on the scales and the boy was named Billy.\n\nYears passed, and Nana quietly oversaw the workings of the village - as it grew to be a thriving little hamlet and, eventually, a full-fledged town. When she'd been married to Thomas she'd been known as Mrs. Coppiest-Baker - but now she was simply known to all as Nana. She was the heart of the town - watching over the comings and goings like a mother hen, quietly taking notes in the weekly town meetings as she had been for more than forty years. She still baked biscuits, smiled often, and listend with care - but she was beginning to worry that time would not grant her a chance to look upon Willie's successor.\n\nEventually young Billy grew up and married a bright young woman named Esme from afar. She was an immagrent from the southlands with long hair and eyes so bright they startled. Some muttered unkindly that she must have some Elf in her but Nana embraced her new granddaughter-in-law with open arms and those who cast aspersions were quick to learn that kindly old Nana still had a sharp tongue in her head when she had a mind to use it. Soon Billy and Esme began their own family and, once agin, it was daughter after daughter - most of them drawn to coppiest work like their father but all of them also bearing their mother's startlingly bright eyes.\n\nNana was delighted if a bit bewildered by this generation. They were bold and fearless - only two seemed keen to follow in their father's footsteps as coppiests and none were in a rush to marry. More than once - as she was about to speak up and suggest that Billy impose a smidgen of order on his brood - she recalled that she herself had once been all these things - and so she smiled and held her tongue, hugged more, baked more, and scolded less.\n\nAnd then, again late in life, a seventh child arrived. Sadly Esme was not well. A dark illness had taken her late in her term and where once she had been the light and beating heart of the family, she now struggled through each day. For the sake of the babe in her womb, Esme clung to life as a mountineer clings to a rocky cliff - second-by-second, minute-by-minute, grim but unyielding. By sheer will she made it, and the child, a boy, was born healthy and strong - but childbirth took the very last of Esme's strength and she passed the next day. Billy was inconsolable with grief. Even had he known how to raise a child - an art he'd left fully in Esme's hands - he'd have been in no state. So Nana, for the first time in nearly 70 years, closed up her baking shop - and took the task of raising the babe into her own aged but loving hands. In her first mnaternal act, she named the boy: Burt.\n\nBurt's Childhood:\n\nFrom an early age Nana spotted an adventuresome streak in young Burt. He hated the coppiest chamber and would run outdoors the moment his father took his eyes off him. And he loved working with his hands. He would dig in mud, climb trees, and build 'castles' out of rocks all day if allowed, in all weather too. Young Burty, as Nana called him, reveled in conditions that made hardened farmers bolt the shutters fast.\n\nHis Father, Billy, was apt to be hard on Burt. First there was the matter of Esme's death - which Billy could never quite separate in his mind from Burt's arrival. Also, Billy was ambitious in a small way. Billy had had great expectations when at last a son had come along. Having come from five generations of coppiests he dreamed that Burt might become a church or even royal scribe. As time passed, it became clear that this was not to be. Not only was it impossible to keep the child at the task, but when he was firmly set down to the work and watched, Burt was awful at it. He always reached for the quill with his left hand - no matter how many times his Father scolded him on the matter - and when he did finally get to coppying, the results were mis-spelled and illegible. In a different time and place, a kind hearted teacher might have recognized in Burt some common learning disabilities and offered some work-arounds. But in a small village where your family profesion was your future and your name, Burt's lack of penmanship was no small practical matter. And to his father, it was simply disasterous.\n\nBut Nana's eyes could see little Burtie's streths as well as his flaws - and her heart saw the streak of her beloved Willie within him - and so she took him under her protective wing.\n\nOne afternoon when Burt was about five and had run off from his coppying work (again) Billy fumed to Nana 'That boy will never amount to the least of coppiests - I can't even trust him to refill an ink pot!'\n\n'Billy, you're right - it's not his calling - but he'd make a fine baker.'\n\n'Bah - we've three baker's in town already and it's low manual work - barely even a craft. And besides, craft that it is, whose going to teach it to him, I'll ask you?!' declaraed Billy in frustration (Billy's professional mind was deeply set towards the world of coppying and he was apt to forget that Nana had been the leading baker in town for over half a century).\n\n'I will.' said Nana. She rose and called Burt from his play in the woods and showed him to the back room where the old ovens stood dormant. And from that day forward, Nana was both mother and master.\n\nBurt thrived Under Nana's wing. He loved baking and had a natural talent for it. He spent many happy hours kneeding dough, stirring batter, and tending to the ovens. Nana also introduced him to reading - which Burt took to much more readily than copying - and he soon became an avid, if diffident, reader of whatever text he could gat ahold of. Nana also encouraged Burt's vigor and wanderlust. She put him to work chopping wood and hauling well water for several elderly neighbors, sent him into the forrest to gather all manner of ingredients (after first teaching him how to navigate in the wild), and, to Burt's utter delight, taught him to box sufficiently well that the local bullies gave their lane a wide birth.\n\nIn short, Burt's life had gone from a daily dread of copying work and the low opinion of his father, to a constant delight in baking, reading, and rambling. The proudest moment of his life was when, on his ninth birthday, Nana taught Burt the recipie for her biscuits - a secret she had shared with no one else ever. But in the midst of Burt's joy, there was a hard truth that was becoming harder to ignore... Nana was, at long last, growing old. People had been saying that she was 'getting on' for some time already - though they didn't often say it in front of Burt, at least not more than once, because he was apt to charge at them with a furry that could knock even stout souls off their feet. But it was true. No one knew how old Nana was - not even Nana - but the years were catching up with her. She would sometimes repeat herself or forget what she was saying half way through. And for the first time, her eyes looked tired.\n\nNana died just three months after Burt's ninth birthday. She passed on the evening of the Spring Festival, 84 years to the day since the King of Bright Castle spent the night negotiating with a beautiful young baker regarding the price of bread. She died with her eyes closed, a peaceful smile on her face, and in her final hour, she did her best to comfort and council her favorite great grandson - but young Burt was inconsolable. He wept for days. Strove about the forest wailing at all hours. And leapt on anyone who so much as looked his way.\n\nAfter a fortnight, Billy sat Burt down, gave him the best pep talk he could muster, and told him it was time to put the past behind him and return to the coppiest's chamber. Burt looked his Father in the eye, took his grown up hand in both of his own small paws, and said 'Pa, I'm a Baker. So baking's a what I'm going to go an' do.' And after wiping a final tear from one eye, that what he did.\n\nBurt as a Young Man:\n\nIn the span of thirteen short years, with the hoisting of many trays of bread and the causing of not just a small bit of mischief, little Burty grew to be a strapping young man of twenty two and the most successful baker in town. It's true, there was still some lingering tension with his father regarding profession. But in general, Burt was a happy-go-lucky fellow, carefree and equally at ease telling tales to a crowded bar, striding through the forest alone, or applying the fine details to a child's birthday cake. Affable, and easy-going, he was prone to thinking the best of everyone he met - but had a reckless streak and a left hook more than capable of sorting out anyone who thought to take advantage of his good nature. He was successful at work, a personality at the pub, and a lovable mess of a project in the realm of romance.\n\nAt the moment, Burt had a starry-eyed crush on Chrissy Brewer, widely regarded as the prettiest and craziest girl in town. Burt was actually good friends with Chrissy's younger sister Cecily. They had met each other as youngsters via a mutual love for books. Back in these days, even a thriving town had limited reading material and they bonded as they searched together for anything new and written down. Cecily was more than a bit sour about Burt's infatuation with Chrissy - warning him bluntly that he was just one more moth to the flame - but Burt was not one to let competition - or good advice - sway him from a pursuit.\n\nAnd so it was, that one boisterous Friday night at the pub, perhaps after a pint more than usual, and just after Chrissy had declared it to be 'the most terrible and fearful place in all the wide land', Burt swore boldly to all assembled that he would march up to Dark Castle the very next day - and if there was treasure in it, he aimed haul it out and buy a round for everyone!"

Giving an item to a creature may generate a useful response - particularly if it's an object that the creature has an opinion about. Alas, not all encounters can be resolved amicably - and for these cases there is the 'attack' command. Not surprisingly, this can generate a very hostile response (see 'help attack' for more info).

If you use a verb that is typically performmed with an object (e.g. 'lock', 'unlock', or 'attack') - but omit the the 'with' clause - Dark Castle will assume that you want to perform the command with the object in your hand. 'to' is used with the verbs 'show' and 'give'. This allows you to specify which creature you want to show or give items to.
