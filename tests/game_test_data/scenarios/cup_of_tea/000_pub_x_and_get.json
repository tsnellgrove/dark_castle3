    "\n*** Pub ***\n\nYou are in your family's pub. Sunlight streams through the windows showing a room full of well-worn tables and chairs with a large bar standing across from the entrance. Any moment the regulars will arrive, clamoring for their favorite brews, arguing loudly over sports and poltics, and hurling darts in the general direction of the dart board - and the pub will ignite with sound and motion.\n\nThere is a Creaky Door to the south.\n\nThere is a Dingy Shelf here. The Dingy Shelf contains: a Rusty Key. \n\nThere is a Comfy Chair here. The Comfy Chair is empty. \n\nThe following items are here: a Tea Cup (containing a Tea). \n",

Of course you're also the more homely and introverted daughter - more fond of books than boys they say. Your older sister, Chrissy, the queen of the viallage, has always had a dozzen men at a time circling her in eratic orbits, moths to the flame - so who would ever notice you?\n\nIn your off hand you hold a Brass Lantern.\n",
