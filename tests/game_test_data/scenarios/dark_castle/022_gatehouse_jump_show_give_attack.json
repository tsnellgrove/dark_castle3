    "\n*** Gatehouse ***\n\nYou are in the Gatehouse. This sparse but serviceable room guards the entrance to the main castle. Once upon a time it no-doubt bristled with alert guards bearing gleaming arms. Today, it is filled with old furniture, cobwebs, and a musty smell. Dim light filters in from the arrow slits facing the moat while the shadows at the north end of the room hint at the darkness of the main castle beyond.\n\nUpon the wall hangs a Shiny Sword of great antinquity. \n\nThere is a Front Gate to the south and a Foreboding Archway to the north.\n\nThere is a Wooden Shelf here. The Wooden Shelf is empty. \n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is here. The Royal Hedgehog is wearing: a Red Bandana.\n",

Yep - that's you Burt - A fine specimen of a man. If not for the belching, farting, and cussing I don't know how you'd ever manage to fend off the ladies!\n\nIn your off hand you hold a Brass Lantern.\n\nYou are holding a Rusty Key. \n\nIn your backpack you have: a Cheese Wedge, a Paper Bag, and an Earthen Jug (containing a Well Water). \n",

    "\nThis is an elven sword of great antiquity. The shiny sword glitters even in the dim light. Despite its age, the edge is keen and looks ready for action. There are elven runes engraved upon the blade.\n\n\nYour sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.\nOn the Shiny Sword you see: Elven Runes. \n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is nearly done eating all of the Stale Biscuits and is beginning to look around a bit.\n",

It's loyal gaze changes to one of bewilderment and hearbreak. 'Et tu Burtus?' Even as the loyal little creature gives way, you know in your heart that you will come to regret this unkingly deed.\n\nThe Shiny Sword swings through the air with a blazing-fast assault. The Royal Hedgehog is terrirfied and flees from the unprovoked attack. \n\nYour score is now 0 out of 75\n"
