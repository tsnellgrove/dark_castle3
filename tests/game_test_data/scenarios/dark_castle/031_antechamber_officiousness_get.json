    "\n*** Gatehouse ***\n\nYou are in the Gatehouse. This sparse but serviceable room guards the entrance to the main castle. Once upon a time it no-doubt bristled with alert guards bearing gleaming arms. Today, it is filled with old furniture, cobwebs, and a musty smell. Dim light filters in from the arrow slits facing the moat while the shadows at the north end of the room hint at the darkness of the main castle beyond.\n\nUpon the wall hangs a Shiny Sword of great antinquity. \n\nThere is a Front Gate to the south and a Foreboding Archway to the north.\n\nThere is a Wooden Shelf here. The Wooden Shelf is empty. \n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is here. The Royal Hedgehog is wearing: a Red Bandana.\n",
    "\nOpenned. The Paper Bag contains: a Baked Biscuit. \n",
    "\nWith a yelp of grateful delight the starving hedgehog leaps upon the Baked Biscuit and begins to devour them.\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is ravenously devouring the Stale Biscuits and is taking no notice of you at all.\n",
    "\nTaken\n\nYour score is now 20 out of 75\n\nWith the Shiny Sword in hand you are now armed and dangerous!\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog has eaten through half the Stale Biscuits but is still giving them all of its attention.\n\nYour sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.\n",
    "\n*** Antechamber ***\n\nYou are in a what feels more like a wide, tall-ceilinged corridor than a room. Apparently this is the room-before-the-room, the pre-room before the really, really grand room that comes after it. If so, the next room must be quite something because, back in it's day, this spot was clearly impressive. Alas, like all of the castle, it has fallen on dark times and now feels more sinister than grand. The east and west walls are bare stone with exits to the north and south. \n\nNear the north exit, on the west wall, there is a small alcove. It appears to have some kind of apparatus in it but you can't see it very well due to the dim light and the Guard Goblin standing in front of it, glowering at you. The whole north end of the room is cloaked in shadows that make you uneasy.\n\nThere is a Lit Archway to the south and an Iron Portcullis to the north.\n\nThe Guard Goblin is here. The Guard Goblin is holding a Grimy Axe. The Guard Goblin is wearing: a Big Medal.\n\nYour sword has begun to glow very brightly\n",

    "\nIt should be emphasized that the sort of officiousness that the Guard Goblin displays is not of the kind that involves being overly helpful. Rather, it is the sort of officiousness that is assertive of authority in an annoyingly domineering way, especially with regard to petty or trivial rules and regulations. \n\nIt is said that a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds - and the Guard Goblin wears its astringent officiousness like a shiny badge of honor. It scrutinizes you with a displeased frown of disaproval and a captious shake of the head. At any moment the Guard Goblin looks likely to ask you whether you've recieved the memo about the new cover sheet for the Treaspassing Permit Suspension reports.\n",
    "\nYou can't take the Big Medal. It belongs to the Guard Goblin!\n",
    "\nIt seems that by entering the north side of the room you have violated a minor castle ordinance. The Guard Goblin is incensed and will not tolerate this flagrant defiance of orthodoxy!\n\nThe Guard Goblin attacks with the Grimy Axe and you attempt to parry with the Shiny Sword!\n\nThe Grimy Axe arcs through the air with a lightening-fast stroke. You are only barely able to parry the assult! \n",

    "\nThe Guard Goblin peers at you with malace from the north end of the room. It stands in the Alcove guarding a mysterious aperatus of some sort. It wears a crisply ironed uniform and gives off an air of hauty, even vicious, Officiousness. The Guard Goblin is armed and dangerous and clearly takes its guard duties very seriously. It would not be wise to approach the Iron Portcullis or the Alcove (or the Guard Goblin!) un-armed.\n\nThe Guard Goblin is holding a Grimy Axe. The Guard Goblin is wearing: a Big Medal.\n",

    "\n(with the Shiny Sword)\n\nYou attack with the Shiny Sword and the Guard Goblin attempts to parry with the Grimy Axe!\n\nThe Shiny Sword surges with power and lethal heft in your hand. A preternatural calm comes over you. You were born for this moment. Your raucous pub crawling days were a mere temporary distraction. You know in your bones that this primal showdown was meant to be and that, with the Shiny Sword at your command, you were meant to win it. Resolute, and with a confidence you have never even imagined having up until this very moment, you stride forward to meet your foe in battle.\n\nThe Shiny Sword swings through the air with a blazing-fast assault. The Guard Goblin is slain by the blazing-fast strike! \n\nYour score is now 25 out of 75\n\nYour sword is no longer glowing.\n",
