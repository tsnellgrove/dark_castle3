    "\n*** Throne Room ***\n",
    "\n*** Throne Room ***\n\nThe room you're currently in is vast - almost cavernous. At the far end sits what must have once been a grand and glorious throne.  On either wall there are tall ruined windows - now shattered and completely choked with thorned vines - but you you remember hearing stories from your great grandmother, Nana, of the beautiful, glowing stained glass that once filled them. And above the room's entrance hangs a vast (though quite dusty) family tree.\n\nTo the right of the throne is an elegant pedestal that holds what appears to be a delicate crystal box. To the left of the throne is a giant stone coffer. \n\nThere is an Iron Portcullis to the south.\n\nThere is a Throne here. The Throne is empty. \n\nThere is an Elegant Pedestal here. The Elegant Pedestal contains: a Crystal Box. \n",
    "\nHigh-backed and intricately carved, the throne is secured to the floor and wedged against the castle wall behind it. It does not look entirely comfortable but it must have once been very grand indeed. Alas, like the rest of Dark Castle, it is now dingy and ominous with only faint hints of its past glory. The throne must have heard many secrets in its time... perhaps it still holds some?\n\nThe Throne is empty. \n",
    "\nYou are now seated in the Throne.\n\nSitting in the throne, it feels slightly out of kilter - as if it's been pushed or pulled out of alignment by something...\n\nFrom your position on the Throne you can just reach: Crystal Box\n",

    "\nPushed.\n\nYou push hard on the throne. Nothing happens but one side of the throne feels a bit askew - as if something was wedged behind it. Strange...\n",
    "\nPulled.\n\nHoping to find some sort of secret compartment filled with gold - or at least a good souvenir to show to the lads back at the pub - you pull and prod the throne. As you are pulling the throne forward you hear a metallic 'clank' and something rolls out from beneath the throne.. it appears to be a hedgehog broach. It must have been wedged between the throne and the castle wall all these years... since the days of the last King! The sight of it brings back old memories... \n\nYou have a strong urge to examine the hedgehog broach more closely.\n",
    "\nTaken\n\nYour score is now 40 out of 75\n\nWith the Shiny Sword no longer in hand, you are a bit more approachable.\n",
    "\nThe silver Hedgehog Broach is about an inch in diameter and is carved with the crest of a hedgehog bearing a sword and a key. It's strangely familiar... you've seen one just like it... long ago... examining the Hedgehog Broach up close triggers a long forgotten memory...\n\nYou were only nine years old... it was the evening of the Spring Festival but you and all your family were gathered inside, at the bedside of your great grandmother, Nana Baker. She was old - very, very old - so old no even was sure how old - not even Nana. She'd been unable to eat or get out of bed for the past week and the village healer had given his solemn verdict that at long last her time had come. The whole village had come round to pay their last respects but now it was just family left. She looked very tired and her eyes were closed.\n\n'Billy', said Nana, meaning your father, 'I'm weary... be a good lad and go heat me some tea... Nice and hot please.'. Next she sent your aunt off for a special pillow she'd loaned to a friend. Soon every member of the family was off on an errand and it was just you and Nana.\n\nQuite suddenly, Nana's eyes opened, bright blue and wide awake. 'Well, Burty, finally we can have a little chat. I wish you were a bit older but now will have to do. Tell me Burty, how did ya feel about copying lines?'\n\n'It wasn' so bad' you'd stammered back.\n\nNana laughed and gave you a warm smile. 'Don't feel bad Burty, I wasn't much of a Coppiest myself - I was born a Baker and had a bit of a rebellious streak in me - just like you. You remind me so much of my Willy... and that's not entirely an accident mind you. Thought I might see a resemblance in your grandfather or father but they were mindful lads and happy enough to be Coppiests. I guess it's waited for you to show itself. Probably just as well.'\n\n'Ah Willy... now don't get me wrong, Papa Coppiest was a good man - hard working and with a kind heart - took me hand when many others wouldn't have and always treated me kind. But you're from different stock Burty, very different. And that comes with some responsibilities... you've got a destiny 'afore you and that can be hard on young man with no expecting of it. That's why I'm telling you this now.'\n\n'Your real great grandpa was Willy... William Herbert... last of the line of Flatheads... or so everyone's been told. He was a handsome man... like you Burty. And, unlike the rest of his family - full of romance and laughter and travel and adventure. Could be a bit reckless at times but he had a good heart. He proposed to me right proper he did... didn't really have to... he was so high up in society... and so much older too... but the moment I told him he dropped right to one knee and popped the question. Didn't care the least what people said! Swore we'd elope if the high priest wouldn't marry us... and he would have too!'\n\n'Alas, that crazy man... four months before the big day he was wandering about the castle entrance, wearing his bathrobe and Royal Crown, smoking his pipe and reading a book as he walked, as usual, and boom, he trips on the drawbridge and falls right into the Moat! Eaten right up in one big bite by one of those mean old crocodiles that have swum in it forever. Oh the day I heard the news...' And with these words she touched the Hedgehog Broach she always wore over her heart. 'It was a dark day Burty, a dark day for me an' for the castle and all the lands around.'\n\n'Someday Burty William Baker, someday you'll be King. And when you is, you be a good King... a kind and courageous and bold king... and when you is King don't ya be going walking off the edge of the drawbridge with no weapon in your hands and breaking young girl's hearts - you hear me?'\n\nStunned by this strange tale you began to stammer an answer but just then your Father returned with the hot tea. With a wink just for you, Nana's eyes closed again and she sank back into the bed. Minutes later she was gone.\n\n    For years and years you wondered what she was talking about and eventually you began to doubt the conversation had ever even happened. Over time and surpressed by grief, it had faded completely... but here in Dark Castle, with the Hedgehog Broach before you, the memory is clear and real. Nana was buried with her beloved broach - she had insisted on it. This must have been a matching mate - presumably worn by Willy himself.\n",
    "\nPushed.\n\nNothing happens.\n",
    "\nPulled.\n\nNothing happens.\n",
    "\nYou are now seated in the Throne.\n\nFrom your position on the Throne you can just reach: Crystal Box\n",
    "\nWorn.\n\nThere's no sign of magical properties but you're confident that Nana would be glad to see the Hedgehog Broach being worn in the castle again after all these years. You pause and wonder if there are any lessons you can still learn from Nana's last words to you...\n"
