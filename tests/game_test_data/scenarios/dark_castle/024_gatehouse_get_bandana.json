    "\n*** Gatehouse ***\n\nYou are in the Gatehouse. This sparse but serviceable room guards the entrance to the main castle. Once upon a time it no-doubt bristled with alert guards bearing gleaming arms. Today, it is filled with old furniture, cobwebs, and a musty smell. Dim light filters in from the arrow slits facing the moat while the shadows at the north end of the room hint at the darkness of the main castle beyond.\n\nUpon the wall hangs a Shiny Sword of great antinquity. \n\nThere is a Front Gate to the south and a Foreboding Archway to the north.\n\nThere is a Wooden Shelf here. The Wooden Shelf is empty. \n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is here. The Royal Hedgehog is wearing: a Red Bandana.\n",
    "\nThe ragged red bandana simultaneously projects juanty air of a fluffy dog at the park - and also the rugged look of a legendary martial arts master ready for their final showdown.\n",
    "\nYou can't take the Red Bandana. It belongs to the Royal Hedgehog!\n",
    "\nThe Royal Hedgehog attacks with its Fierce Teeth and you attempt to parry with the Rusty Key!\n\nThe moment you approach the Shiny Sword the territorial Royal Hedgehog springs forward, blocks your path, and bares it's Fierce Teeth.\n\nYou are startled and compelled to leap back in surprise. \n",
    "\nThe Royal Hedgehog has huge incisors that could tear a... well wait, that's just not true... the Royal Hedgehog, being of the mamilian Erinaceinae family, has small flat teeth like every other hedgehog. But he has such a good natured look to him that it's quite startling to see him roused!\n",
    "\nYou cast an apraising inner eye and take stock: Manly rough-and-tumble good looks - check, Affable demeanor paired with self-depreciating humor - check!, A lifetime of finely-honed baking skills - check!! Yep - that's you Burt - A fine specimen of a man. If not for the belching, farting, and cussing I don't know how you'd ever manage to fend off the ladies!\n\nIn your off hand you hold a Brass Lantern.\n\nYou are holding a Rusty Key. \n\nIn your backpack you have: a Cheese Wedge, a Paper Bag, and an Earthen Jug (containing a Well Water). \n",
    "\nStowed\n",
    "\n(with your Fist)\n\nYou attack with your Fist and the Royal Hedgehog attempts to dodge!\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog seems to view your unarmed swipe as a playful challenge. It drops into a martial arts pose and begins making wax-on, wax-off motions with its paws.\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is easily able to duck and dodge the blow. \n",
    "\nYep, that's your fist. Still bruised from the last time you swung and missed and hit a wall...\n",
    "\nYou can't drop your Fist - you're quite attached to it.\n",
    "\nBurt, you can't stow your Fist - you're quite attached to it.\n",
    "\nJust how do you intend to pick up a Fist?\n"
