    "\n*** Entrance ***\n\nYou stand upon the ancient drawbridge at the entrance of Dark Castle. The murky waters of the moat swirl beneath your feet and, before you, barring your way, is the ominous front gate.\n\nBehind you, just beyond the drawbridge, is an extremely old and rusty postbox besides which stands a large tree with some low branches. Across the way from the postbox is a big rock covered in moss and lichen. \n\nThere is a Front Gate to the north, a climb leading up, an Untrodden Path to the southwest, a leap down to the moat to the east, and a leap down to the moat to the west.\n",

    "\nOpenned. \n\nYour score is now 10 out of 75\n",
    "\n*** Gatehouse ***\n\nYou are in the Gatehouse. This sparse but serviceable room guards the entrance to the main castle. Once upon a time it no-doubt bristled with alert guards bearing gleaming arms. Today, it is filled with old furniture, cobwebs, and a musty smell. Dim light filters in from the arrow slits facing the moat while the shadows at the north end of the room hint at the darkness of the main castle beyond.\n\nUpon the wall hangs a Shiny Sword of great antinquity. \n\nThere is a Front Gate to the south and a Foreboding Archway to the north.\n\nThere is a Wooden Shelf here. The Wooden Shelf is empty. \n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is here. The Royal Hedgehog is wearing: a Red Bandana.\n",
    "\nThe arrow slits are high up on the south wall on either side of the Front Gate. Maybe there were once step-stools for the archers to stand on? If not, those archers were mighty tall! Peeking through one of the slits you see the moat and fading sunlight beyond. Will you ever return along that untrodden path to your little village below?\n",
    "\nThis is an elven sword of great antiquity. The shiny sword glitters even in the dim light. Despite its age, the edge is keen and looks ready for action. There are elven runes engraved upon the blade.\n\nOn the Shiny Sword you see: Elven Runes. \n",
    "\n'Goblin Wallopper'\n",

    "\nThe front gate is 12 feet tall, six feet wide, and is reenforced with mighty steel bands. There is rusty lettering, composed of crudely hammered nails, across the top of the gate and a rusty keyhole at chest height.\n\nThe Front Gate is open. On the Front Gate you see: Rusty Lettering. \n",
    "\n'ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO EVEN THINK ABOUT IT'\n",
    "\nThe foreboding archway leads away from the half-light of the Gateway and into the gloom and darkness of castle itself. You feel both hesitation and excitement. Without a doubt, your true adventure begins when you step through the archway.\n",

    "\nThis poor little Royal Hedgehog has seen better days. It looks gaunt and like it skipped breakfast - and maybe lunch and dinner too. But despite a somewhat bedraggled appearance, the Royal Hedgehog has an air of fierce Loyalty about it. It may be in need of a good meal, but the Royal Hedgehog's eyes shine with the bright gleam of devoted guardian. It also appears to have quite a preference for shiny things. You don't know why but you feel an innate fondness for this small but faithful creature.\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is wearing: a Red Bandana.\n",
    "\nThe ragged red bandana simultaneously projects juanty air of a fluffy dog at the park - and also the rugged look of a legendary martial arts master ready for their final showdown.\n",

    "\n*** Antechamber ***\n\nYou are in a what feels more like a wide, tall-ceilinged corridor than a room. Apparently this is the room-before-the-room, the pre-room before the really, really grand room that comes after it. If so, the next room must be quite something because, back in it's day, this spot was clearly impressive. Alas, like all of the castle, it has fallen on dark times and now feels more sinister than grand. The east and west walls are bare stone with exits to the north and south. \n\nNear the north exit, on the west wall, there is a small alcove. It appears to have some kind of apparatus in it but you can't see it very well due to the dim light and the Guard Goblin standing in front of it, glowering at you. The whole north end of the room is cloaked in shadows that make you uneasy.\n\nThere is a Lit Archway to the south and an Iron Portcullis to the north.\n\nThe Guard Goblin is here. The Guard Goblin is holding a Grimy Axe. The Guard Goblin is wearing: a Big Medal.\n",
