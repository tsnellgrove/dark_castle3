    "\n*** Entrance ***\n\nYou stand upon the ancient drawbridge at the entrance of Dark Castle. The murky waters of the moat swirl beneath your feet and, before you, barring your way, is the ominous front gate.\n\nBehind you, just beyond the drawbridge, is an extremely old and rusty postbox besides which stands a large tree with some low branches. Across the way from the postbox is a big rock covered in moss and lichen. \n\nThere is a Front Gate to the north, a climb leading up, an Untrodden Path to the southwest, a leap down to the moat to the east, and a leap down to the moat to the west.\n",
    "\nA large oak tree with low-hanging branches stands just beyond the rusty postbox. Its gnarled trunk and sprawling limbs give it a majestic appearance, despite the dark and gloomy surroundings of Dark Castle. The tree seems to offer a small refuge from the foreboding atmosphere of the castle entrance.\n",
    "\n(choosing the 'up' direction in which to climb)\n\nWith a jump to the first branch you clamber up the trail-side tree.\n\n*** Up Tree ***\n\nYou are perched in a large tree about ten feet above the ground. The nearest branch above you is above your reach. From your vantage point, Dark Castle looms as darkly as ever and the moat looks even more vile and unappealing than it does from the drawbridge. Still, the tree's wide branches are grand and calming.\n\nJust above you - where the next branch should be - is a tree hollow. By standing on your tippy-toes on your current branch, you could just peek into it. \n\nThere is a climb leading down.\n\nOn the ground below you can see: a Postbox. \n",
    "\nDark Castle looms over you. Its facade of blackened turrets and cracked battlements is dour and singlularly univiting and the sky above it foreboding and eternally overcast in dark storm clouds. It's hard to imagine but your great grandma Nana used to tell wonderous stories of the old days when the castle gleamed brightly on its hill and was a beacon of order and goodness for the land. Maybe it's because of the stories, but you've always had a bit of an itch to venture inside. The place has somehow called to you - almost daring you to enter... And now that a round of beer and your alehouse repuation as a fearless ruffian (and perhaps even the attentions of young miss Chrissy Brewer!) are on the line, you intend to answer the call!\n",
    "\nFrom your lofty perch up in the tree you can see the moat below you. From up here it's clear that the water isn't swirling randomly. You're now quite confident that there are multiple large creatures inhabting the moat - and you suspect that they re not friendly.\n",
    "\nFrom your lofty perch up in the tree you can see the drawbridge below you. From up here, it looks even more rickety and worn and the bite marks are clearer - definitely crocs - and some of them made recently.\n",
    "\nThe hollow in the tree trunk is just big enough to hold a small object. It looks like it might once have held the winter nut store of an enterprising squirell but, if so, the nuts have all been consumed.\n\nThe Tree Hollow contains: a Red Ruby. \n",
    "\nTaken\n",
    "\nA glittering red ruby, about the size of a walnut. This is a real treasure! For a moment you imagine the smile of delight from miss Chrissy Brewer as you triumphantly present it to her.\n",
    "\nDone\n",
    "\nThe hollow in the tree trunk is just big enough to hold a small object. It looks like it might once have held the winter nut store of an enterprising squirell but, if so, the nuts have all been consumed.\n\nThe Tree Hollow contains: a Cheese Wedge. \n",

Yep - that's you Burt - A fine specimen of a man. If not for the belching, farting, and cussing I don't know how you'd ever manage to fend off the ladies!\n\nIn your off hand you hold a Brass Lantern.\n\nIn your backpack you have: a Rusty Key, a Paper Bag, an Earthen Jug (containing a Well Water), and a Red Ruby. \n",
