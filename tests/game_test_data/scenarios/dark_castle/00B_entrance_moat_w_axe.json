    "\nI don't see the word 'with' in that sentence.\n",
    "\nUnlocked\n",
    "\nOpenned. \n\nYour score is now 10 out of 75\n",
    "\n*** Gatehouse ***\n\nYou are in the Gatehouse. This sparse but serviceable room guards the entrance to the main castle. Once upon a time it no-doubt bristled with alert guards bearing gleaming arms. Today, it is filled with old furniture, cobwebs, and a musty smell. Dim light filters in from the arrow slits facing the moat while the shadows at the north end of the room hint at the darkness of the main castle beyond.\n\nUpon the wall hangs a Shiny Sword of great antinquity. \n\nThere is a Front Gate to the south and a Foreboding Archway to the north.\n\nThere is a Wooden Shelf here. The Wooden Shelf is empty. \n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is here. The Royal Hedgehog is wearing: a Red Bandana.\n",
    "\nOpenned. The Paper Bag contains: a Baked Biscuit. \n",
    "\nWith a yelp of grateful delight the starving hedgehog leaps upon the Baked Biscuit and begins to devour them.\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is ravenously devouring the Stale Biscuits and is taking no notice of you at all.\n",
    "\nTaken\n\nYour score is now 20 out of 75\n\nWith the Shiny Sword in hand you are now armed and dangerous!\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog has eaten through half the Stale Biscuits but is still giving them all of its attention.\n\nYour sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.\n",
    "\n*** Antechamber ***\n\nYou are in a what feels more like a wide, tall-ceilinged corridor than a room. Apparently this is the room-before-the-room, the pre-room before the really, really grand room that comes after it. If so, the next room must be quite something because, back in it's day, this spot was clearly impressive. Alas, like all of the castle, it has fallen on dark times and now feels more sinister than grand. The east and west walls are bare stone with exits to the north and south. \n\nNear the north exit, on the west wall, there is a small alcove. It appears to have some kind of apparatus in it but you can't see it very well due to the dim light and the Guard Goblin standing in front of it, glowering at you. The whole north end of the room is cloaked in shadows that make you uneasy.\n\nThere is a Lit Archway to the south and an Iron Portcullis to the north.\n\nThe Guard Goblin is here. The Guard Goblin is holding a Grimy Axe. The Guard Goblin is wearing: a Big Medal.\n\nYour sword has begun to glow very brightly\n",
    "\nIt should be emphasized that the sort of officiousness that the Guard Goblin displays is not of the kind that involves being overly helpful. Rather, it is the sort of officiousness that is assertive of authority in an annoyingly domineering way, especially with regard to petty or trivial rules and regulations. \n\nIt is said that a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds - and the Guard Goblin wears its astringent officiousness like a shiny badge of honor. It scrutinizes you with a displeased frown of disaproval and a captious shake of the head. At any moment the Guard Goblin looks likely to ask you whether you've recieved the memo about the new cover sheet for the Treaspassing Permit Suspension reports.\n",
    "\n(with the Shiny Sword)\n\nYou attack with the Shiny Sword and the Guard Goblin attempts to parry with the Grimy Axe!\n\nThe Shiny Sword surges with power and lethal heft in your hand. A preternatural calm comes over you. You were born for this moment. Your raucous pub crawling days were a mere temporary distraction. You know in your bones that this primal showdown was meant to be and that, with the Shiny Sword at your command, you were meant to win it. Resolute, and with a confidence you have never even imagined having up until this very moment, you stride forward to meet your foe in battle.\n\nThe Shiny Sword swings through the air with a blazing-fast assault. The Guard Goblin is slain by the blazing-fast strike! \n\nYour score is now 25 out of 75\n\nYour sword is no longer glowing.\n",
    "\nDropped\n\nWith the Shiny Sword no longer in hand, you are a bit more approachable.\n",
    "\nTaken\n\nWith the Grimy Axe in hand you are now armed and dangerous!\n",
    "\n*** Gatehouse ***\n\nYou are in the Gatehouse. This sparse but serviceable room guards the entrance to the main castle. Once upon a time it no-doubt bristled with alert guards bearing gleaming arms. Today, it is filled with old furniture, cobwebs, and a musty smell. Dim light filters in from the arrow slits facing the moat while the shadows at the north end of the room hint at the darkness of the main castle beyond.\n\nThere is a Front Gate to the south and a Foreboding Archway to the north.\n\nThere is a Wooden Shelf here. The Wooden Shelf is empty. \n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is here. The Royal Hedgehog is wearing: a Red Bandana.\n",
    "\n*** Entrance ***\n\nYou stand upon the ancient drawbridge at the entrance of Dark Castle. The murky waters of the moat swirl beneath your feet and, before you, barring your way, is the ominous front gate.\n\nBehind you, just beyond the drawbridge, is an extremely old and rusty postbox besides which stands a large tree with some low branches. Across the way from the postbox is a big rock covered in moss and lichen. \n\nThere is a Front Gate to the north, a climb leading up, an Untrodden Path to the southwest, a leap down to the moat to the east, and a leap down to the moat to the west.\n",
    "\nWith courage and boldness to spare you leap from the drawbridge into the murky waters of the Moat. A less resolute adventurer might have turned tail at the sight of the oncoming giant crocodile but not you Burt. Treading water with your feet you take a two-handed grip on your weapon and get ready to face your destiny. Just before reaching you the primitive reptile realizes that you are armed and ready to fight (crocs are famously near-sighted). In surprise and fear it belches up the contents of it's stomach - including the Royal Crown - and flees in fear. With a deft athleticism unlike anything you've ever displayed before today you stow your weapon, snag the Royal Crown before it sinks, and in one smooth motion adroitly hoist yourself back onto the drawbridge one handed. The lads at the pub would fall over at the sight of your skill and courage! (though mind you, they fall over on a regular basis as it is)\n\nWith the Grimy Axe no longer in hand, you are a bit more approachable.\n",
    "\nWorn.\n\nYou now feel more regal.\n\nYour score is now 35 out of 75\n",
    "\nTaken\n\nWith the Grimy Axe in hand you are now armed and dangerous!\n",
    "\nWith courage and boldness to spare you leap from the drawbridge into the murky waters of the Moat. Apparently the last time you did this you terrified the local wildlife so much that they are still in hiding. After treading water for a few minutes you clamber back onto the drawbridge.\n"
