    "\nEvery time you look at one of these biscuits you think of your great grandmother Nana, who raised you and taught you how to bake. This baked biscuit in particular came fresh out of the oven just this morning. You ate the rest of the batch on the hike over to Dark Castle and this last biscuits is all that's left. It smells mouth-wateringly delicious. There is an insignia imprinted on the baked biscuit.\n\nOn the Baked Biscuit you see: Insignia. \n",
    "\nOn the Baked Biscuit, written in Insignia, you read: Baked into the biscuit are the symbols of a key and sword. As a child you remember asking your great grandmother Nana why she stamped these onto the front of every biscuit. 'It's a reminder of the past Burty,', she declared, 'and maybe someday, even, of the future.' You were never clear what she meant - but you've loyaly used Nana's original key and sword stamp on every biscuit you've ever baked..\n",
    "\nYou're tempted - this last biscuit smells delicious - but your great grandmother, Nana, who taught you her secret biscuit recipie in the first place, wouldn't abide by it. Nana always insisted that the last biscuit in a batch be given away. As a toddler you would howl that you wanted it more than anyone else in the world but Nana was firm. 'Charity and kindness are the secrect ingredients Burty' she would say. And she meant it. If there was no one handy to give the last biscuit to, she would place it out on the back step 'for a wee good-hearted animal'. But a Baker, she said, should never ever eat the last biscuit in a batch.\n",
    "\nDon't do it Burt! What would Nana say? There might be some poor soul out there wasting away and just yearning for a Baked Biscuit.\n",
    "\nDon't say I didn't warn you burt...\n\nEaten.\n\nSomehow the Baked Biscuit doesn't taste nearly as good as it usually would. You imagine Nana's disapointed expression and you regret eating it already.\n",
