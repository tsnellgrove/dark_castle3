    "\n(with the Shiny Sword)\n\nYou attack with the Shiny Sword and the Guard Goblin attempts to parry with the Grimy Axe!\n\nThe Shiny Sword surges with power and lethal heft in your hand. A preternatural calm comes over you. You were born for this moment. Your raucous pub crawling days were a mere temporary distraction. You know in your bones that this primal showdown was meant to be and that, with the Shiny Sword at your command, you were meant to win it. Resolute, and with a confidence you have never even imagined having up until this very moment, you stride forward to meet your foe in battle.\n\nThe Shiny Sword swings through the air with a blazing-fast assault. The Guard Goblin is slain by the blazing-fast strike! \n\nYour score is now 25 out of 75\n\nYour sword is no longer glowing.\n",

    "\n*** Throne Room ***\n\nThe room you're currently in is vast - almost cavernous. At the far end sits what must have once been a grand and glorious throne.  On either wall there are tall ruined windows - now shattered and completely choked with thorned vines - but you you remember hearing stories from your great grandmother, Nana, of the beautiful, glowing stained glass that once filled them. And above the room's entrance hangs a vast (though quite dusty) family tree.\n\nTo the right of the throne is an elegant pedestal that holds what appears to be a delicate crystal box. To the left of the throne is a giant stone coffer. \n\nThere is an Iron Portcullis to the south.\n\nThere is a Throne here. The Throne is empty. \n\nThere is an Elegant Pedestal here. The Elegant Pedestal contains: a Crystal Box. \n"
