    "\n*** Gatehouse ***\n\nYou are in the Gatehouse. This sparse but serviceable room guards the entrance to the main castle. Once upon a time it no-doubt bristled with alert guards bearing gleaming arms. Today, it is filled with old furniture, cobwebs, and a musty smell. Dim light filters in from the arrow slits facing the moat while the shadows at the north end of the room hint at the darkness of the main castle beyond.\n\nUpon the wall hangs a Shiny Sword of great antinquity. \n\nThere is a Front Gate to the south and a Foreboding Archway to the north.\n\nThere is a Wooden Shelf here. The Wooden Shelf is empty. \n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is here. The Royal Hedgehog is wearing: a Red Bandana.\n",
    "\nOpenned. The Paper Bag contains: a Baked Biscuit. \n",
    "\nWith a yelp of grateful delight the starving hedgehog leaps upon the Baked Biscuit and begins to devour them.\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is ravenously devouring the Stale Biscuits and is taking no notice of you at all.\n",
    "\nThe hedgehog is eating ravenously.\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is wearing: a Red Bandana.\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog has eaten through half the Stale Biscuits but is still giving them all of its attention.\n",
    "\nThis is an elven sword of great antiquity. The shiny sword glitters even in the dim light. Despite its age, the edge is keen and looks ready for action. There are elven runes engraved upon the blade.\n\nOn the Shiny Sword you see: Elven Runes. \n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is nearly done eating all of the Stale Biscuits and is beginning to look around a bit.\n",
    "\nThe hedgehog is eating ravenously.\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is wearing: a Red Bandana.\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog has finished the Stale Biscuits and is vigilantly looking around.\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog now looks considerably more bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.\n",
    "\nThe Royal Hedgehog is looking svelte and chipper. It has the swagger of a hedgehog that has just scored a meal of Stale Biscuits and still has it's favorite shiny possession.\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is wearing: a Red Bandana.\n",
    "\nI don't see a Biscuits here.\n",
    "\nThe Royal Hedgehog attacks with its Fierce Teeth and you attempt to dodge!\n\nThe moment you approach the Shiny Sword the territorial Royal Hedgehog springs forward, blocks your path, and bares it's Fierce Teeth.\n\nYou are startled and compelled to leap back in surprise. \n"
