    "\n*** Entrance ***\n\nYou stand upon the ancient drawbridge at the entrance of Dark Castle. The murky waters of the moat swirl beneath your feet and, before you, barring your way, is the ominous front gate.\n\nBehind you, just beyond the drawbridge, is an extremely old and rusty postbox besides which stands a large tree with some low branches. Across the way from the postbox is a big rock covered in moss and lichen. \n\nThere is a Front Gate to the north, a climb leading up, an Untrodden Path to the southwest, a leap down to the moat to the east, and a leap down to the moat to the west.\n",
    "\nThe drawbridge is worn with time. It creaks as you walk across it and, disconcertingly, there are a series of large, toothy bites taken out of its edges by something big, mean, and nasty.\n",
    "\nDark Castle looms over you. Its facade of blackened turrets and cracked battlements is dour and singlularly univiting and the sky above it foreboding and eternally overcast in dark storm clouds. It's hard to imagine but your great grandma Nana used to tell wonderous stories of the old days when the castle gleamed brightly on its hill and was a beacon of order and goodness for the land. Maybe it's because of the stories, but you've always had a bit of an itch to venture inside. The place has somehow called to you - almost daring you to enter... And now that a round of beer and your alehouse repuation as a fearless ruffian (and perhaps even the attentions of young miss Chrissy Brewer!) are on the line, you intend to answer the call!\n",
    "\nYou know Burt, you've never heard anyone say 'It's a hot out - I think I'll go for a swim in the Dark Castle Moat'... and now you know why. The dark and muddy water just three feet below you swirls in a way that makes you suspect there's something down there you'd rather not meet.\n",
    "\nThe front gate is 12 feet tall, six feet wide, and is reenforced with mighty steel bands. There is rusty lettering, composed of crudely hammered nails, across the top of the gate and a rusty keyhole at chest height.\n\nThe Front Gate is closed. On the Front Gate you see: Rusty Lettering. \n",
    "\n'ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO EVEN THINK ABOUT IT'\n",
    "\nThe postbox was presumably once bright red and shiny but now it is covered in rust and grime. You notice that the once-sturdy lock keeping it secure appears to have recently surendered to the forces of time and decay. The postbox is now ajar.\n\nThe Postbox is closed. On the Postbox you see: Royal Cypher. \n",
    "\n'WR'\n",
    "\nThis is, indeed, a big rock. It looks like you might just barely be able to lift it.\n",
    "\nA large oak tree with low-hanging branches stands just beyond the rusty postbox. Its gnarled trunk and sprawling limbs give it a majestic appearance, despite the dark and gloomy surroundings of Dark Castle. The tree seems to offer a small refuge from the foreboding atmosphere of the castle entrance.\n",
    "\nDon't be ridiculous Burt. You just swore to the whole pub (and to miss Chrissy Brewer too!) that you'd march into Dark Castle, grab the gold, and buy everyone drinks with it. That's why they gave you the rusty key. You can't turn back now!\n",
    "\nWell, the Untrodden Path is a bit misnamed to be honest - because you just trod upon it to get here - but it's certainly not trod on much. It's a narrow, winding trail that leads back down the hill and through the woods to the village in the valley below. It is overgrown with weeds and brambles - not a lot of folks dare to make the journey through grimwood forest and up knife ridge any more - but here you are, Burt!\n",
    "\nYou cast an apraising inner eye and take stock: Manly rough-and-tumble good looks - check, Affable demeanor paired with self-depreciating humor - check!, A lifetime of finely-honed baking skills - check!! Yep - that's you Burt - A fine specimen of a man. If not for the belching, farting, and cussing I don't know how you'd ever manage to fend off the ladies!\n\nIn your off hand you hold a Brass Lantern.\n\nIn your backpack you have: a Rusty Key, a Cheese Wedge, a Paper Bag, and an Earthen Jug (containing a Well Water). \n",
    "\nAn old rusty key... the one you swore to the whole pub (and miss Chrissy Brewer!) that you'd use to pillage the Dark Castle... What could you possibly do with it?\n",
    "\nA small wedge of cheese you absconded with from the larder. It's very small - so small that a lone mouse could probably make off with the whole thing - but but it was recommended by your friend Cecily from the pub - so you suspect it's quite delicious.\n",
    "\nA smartly-creased paper bag. The wonderful smell of fresh-baked biscuts still wafts from it and you wonder if there might be any left?\n\nThe Paper Bag is closed. \n",
    "\nOpenned. The Paper Bag contains: a Baked Biscuit. \n",
    "\nEvery time you look at one of these biscuits you think of your great grandmother Nana, who raised you and taught you how to bake. This baked biscuit in particular came fresh out of the oven just this morning. You ate the rest of the batch on the hike over to Dark Castle and this last biscuits is all that's left. It smells mouth-wateringly delicious. There is an insignia imprinted on the baked biscuit.\n\nOn the Baked Biscuit you see: Insignia. \n",
    "\nBaked into the biscuit are the symbols of a key and sword. As a child you remember asking your great grandmother Nana why she stamped these onto the front of every biscuit. 'It's a reminder of the past Burty,', she declared, 'and maybe someday, even, of the future.' You were never clear what she meant - but you've loyaly used Nana's original key and sword stamp on every biscuit you've ever baked.\n",
    "\nYou cast an apraising inner eye and take stock: Manly rough-and-tumble good looks - check, Affable demeanor paired with self-depreciating humor - check!, A lifetime of finely-honed baking skills - check!! Yep - that's you Burt - A fine specimen of a man. If not for the belching, farting, and cussing I don't know how you'd ever manage to fend off the ladies!\n\nIn your off hand you hold a Brass Lantern.\n\nIn your backpack you have: a Rusty Key, a Cheese Wedge, a Paper Bag (containing a Baked Biscuit), and an Earthen Jug (containing a Well Water). \n",
    "\nAn old earthen jug. According to your Nana, it once belonged to a shifty wizardy fellow who showed up in town and started prying into everyone's cupboards and asking folks if they'd seen any 'loose scrolls'. Nana ran him off with a bread paddle and he scampered so fast he dropped his water jug.\n\nThe Earthen Jug contains: a Well Water. \n",
    "\nAfter your trudge up the hill to Dark Castle the well water looks invitingly refreshing.\n"
