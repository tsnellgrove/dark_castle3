    "\n*** Entrance ***\n\nYou stand upon the ancient drawbridge at the entrance of Dark Castle. The murky waters of the moat swirl beneath your feet and, before you, barring your way, is the ominous front gate.\n\nBehind you, just beyond the drawbridge, is an extremely old and rusty postbox besides which stands a large tree with some low branches. Across the way from the postbox is a big rock covered in moss and lichen. \n\nThere is a Front Gate to the north, a climb leading up, an Untrodden Path to the southwest, a leap down to the moat to the east, and a leap down to the moat to the west.\n",
    "\nYou cast an apraising inner eye and take stock: Manly rough-and-tumble good looks - check, Affable demeanor paired with self-depreciating humor - check!, A lifetime of finely-honed baking skills - check!! Yep - that's you Burt - A fine specimen of a man. If not for the belching, farting, and cussing I don't know how you'd ever manage to fend off the ladies!\n\nIn your off hand you hold a Brass Lantern.\n\nIn your backpack you have: a Rusty Key, a Cheese Wedge, a Paper Bag, and an Earthen Jug (containing a Well Water). \n"
