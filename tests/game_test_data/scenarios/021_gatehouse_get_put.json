    "\n*** Entrance ***\n\nYou stand upon the ancient drawbridge at the entrance of Dark Castle. The murky waters of the moat swirl beneath your feet and, before you, barring your way, is the ominous front gate.\n\nBehind you, just beyond the drawbridge, is an extremely old and rusty postbox besides which stands a large tree with some low branches. Across the way from the postbox is a big rock covered in moss and lichen. \n\nThere is a Front Gate to the north, a climb leading up, an Untrodden Path to the southwest, a leap down to the moat to the east, and a leap down to the moat to the west.\n",

    "\nOpenned. \n\nYour score is now 10 out of 75\n",
    "\n*** Gatehouse ***\n\nYou are in the Gatehouse. This sparse but serviceable room guards the entrance to the main castle. Once upon a time it no-doubt bristled with alert guards bearing gleaming arms. Today, it is filled with old furniture, cobwebs, and a musty smell. Dim light filters in from the arrow slits facing the moat while the shadows at the north end of the room hint at the darkness of the main castle beyond.\n\nUpon the wall hangs a Shiny Sword of great antinquity. \n\nThere is a Front Gate to the south and a Foreboding Archway to the north.\n\nThere is a Wooden Shelf here. The Wooden Shelf is empty. \n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is here. The Royal Hedgehog is wearing: a Red Bandana.\n",
    "\nYou cast an apraising inner eye and take stock: Manly rough-and-tumble good looks - check, Affable demeanor paired with self-depreciating humor - check!, A lifetime of finely-honed baking skills - check!! Yep - that's you Burt - A fine specimen of a man. If not for the belching, farting, and cussing I don't know how you'd ever manage to fend off the ladies!\n\nIn your off hand you hold a Brass Lantern.\n\nYou are holding a Rusty Key. \n\nIn your backpack you have: a Cheese Wedge, a Paper Bag, and an Earthen Jug (containing a Well Water). \n",

    "\nThe Royal Hedgehog attacks with its Fierce Teeth and you attempt to parry with the Rusty Key!\n\nThe moment you approach the Shiny Sword the territorial Royal Hedgehog springs forward, blocks your path, and bares it's Fierce Teeth.\n\nYou are startled and compelled to leap back in surprise. \n",
