    "\nOpenned. \n\nYour score is now 10 out of 75\n",
    "\n*** Gatehouse ***\n\nYou are in the Gatehouse. This sparse but serviceable room guards the entrance to the main castle. Once upon a time it no-doubt bristled with alert guards bearing gleaming arms. Today, it is filled with old furniture, cobwebs, and a musty smell. Dim light filters in from the arrow slits facing the moat while the shadows at the north end of the room hint at the darkness of the main castle beyond.\n\nUpon the wall hangs a Shiny Sword of great antinquity. \n\nThere is a Front Gate to the south and a Foreboding Archway to the north.\n\nThere is a Wooden Shelf here. The Wooden Shelf is empty. \n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is here. The Royal Hedgehog is wearing: a Red Bandana.\n",
    "\nOpenned. The Paper Bag contains: a Baked Biscuit. \n",
    "\nWith a yelp of grateful delight the starving hedgehog leaps upon the Baked Biscuit and begins to devour them.\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is ravenously devouring the Stale Biscuits and is taking no notice of you at all.\n",
    "\nTaken\n\nYour score is now 20 out of 75\n\nWith the Shiny Sword in hand you are now armed and dangerous!\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog has eaten through half the Stale Biscuits but is still giving them all of its attention.\n\nYour sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.\n",
    "\n*** Antechamber ***\n\nYou are in a what feels more like a wide, tall-ceilinged corridor than a room. Apparently this is the room-before-the-room, the pre-room before the really, really grand room that comes after it. If so, the next room must be quite something because, back in it's day, this spot was clearly impressive. Alas, like all of the castle, it has fallen on dark times and now feels more sinister than grand. The east and west walls are bare stone with exits to the north and south. \n\nNear the north exit, on the west wall, there is a small alcove. It appears to have some kind of apparatus in it but you can't see it very well due to the dim light and the Guard Goblin standing in front of it, glowering at you. The whole north end of the room is cloaked in shadows that make you uneasy.\n\nThere is a Lit Archway to the south and an Iron Portcullis to the north.\n\nThe Guard Goblin is here. The Guard Goblin is holding a Grimy Axe. The Guard Goblin is wearing: a Big Medal.\n\nYour sword has begun to glow very brightly\n",
    "\n(with the Shiny Sword)\n\nYou attack with the Shiny Sword and the Guard Goblin attempts to parry with the Grimy Axe!\n\nThe Shiny Sword surges with power and lethal heft in your hand. A preternatural calm comes over you. You were born for this moment. Your raucous pub crawling days were a mere temporary distraction. You know in your bones that this primal showdown was meant to be and that, with the Shiny Sword at your command, you were meant to win it. Resolute, and with a confidence you have never even imagined having up until this very moment, you stride forward to meet your foe in battle.\n\nThe Shiny Sword swings through the air with a blazing-fast assault. The Guard Goblin is slain by the blazing-fast strike! \n\nYour score is now 25 out of 75\n\nYour sword is no longer glowing.\n",
    "\nPulled. The Left Lever is now up.\n",
    "\nPulled. The Right Lever is now up.\n",
    "\nPushed.\n\nYou hear a loud clank, a whirring of gears, and the Iron Portcullis suddenly opens.\n\nYour score is now 35 out of 75\n",
    "\n*** Throne Room ***\n\nThe room you're currently in is vast - almost cavernous. At the far end sits what must have once been a grand and glorious throne.  On either wall there are tall ruined windows - now shattered and completely choked with thorned vines - but you you remember hearing stories from your great grandmother, Nana, of the beautiful, glowing stained glass that once filled them. And above the room's entrance hangs a vast (though quite dusty) family tree.\n\nTo the right of the throne is an elegant pedestal that holds what appears to be a delicate crystal box. To the left of the throne is a giant stone coffer. \n\nThere is an Iron Portcullis to the south.\n\nThere is a Throne here. The Throne is empty. \n\nThere is an Elegant Pedestal here. The Elegant Pedestal contains: a Crystal Box. \n",
    "\nHigh-backed and intricately carved, the throne is secured to the floor and wedged against the castle wall behind it. It does not look entirely comfortable but it must have once been very grand indeed. Alas, like the rest of Dark Castle, it is now dingy and ominous with only faint hints of its past glory. The throne must have heard many secrets in its time... perhaps it still holds some?\n\nThe Throne is empty. \n",
    "\nOn the east and west walls there is a row of floor-to-ceiling windows. The window frames themselves are mostly empty of glass and are now completely choked with a thick growth of thorny vines. The beautiful stained glass that once filled the frames is still strewn about the floor of the room. Nana never spoke about the catastrophe that sundered Bright Castle and rendered it into Dark Castle, but it must have been dramatic!\n",
    "\nThe shattered stained glass is strewn about the floor of the room. Looking at it more closely, you see that in some cases the edges of the glass appear to be badly melted. Whatever dark forces brought about the fall of Bright Castle must have horrifying to behold!\n",
    "\nJust how do you intend to pick up a Stained Glass?\n",
    "\nI don't see a Vines here.\n",
    "\nIt appears to show the family tree of the Flathead dynasty. Though generally agreed to have peaked (nadired?) during the reign of Dimwit Flathead and petered out shortly there-after during the inglorious and flacid rulership of Wurb Flathead, this family tree tells a different story. It claims that an illigitimate child of Wurb, secreted away kept in hiding during the Empire's fall, continued the line for another generation from whence arose William 'The Wanderer' Flathead only a little over 100 years ago. The area below William is indistinct and feels incomplete.. as if there are details still waiting to be filled in.\n\nAt the very top of the family tree you see a royal crest. Oddly enough, it appears to be a Hedgehog bearing a sword and a key. To your astonishment, the insignia looks familiar! The sword and the key - their shape, proportions, and positioning - look exactly the same as decorative insignia on the biscuits your great grandmother Nana taught you to bake as a child. The resemblance is uncanny!\n",

The Elegant Pedestal contains: a Crystal Box. \n",
    "\nThe elegant pedestal is to the right of the throne. Made of polished marble and with ornate carvings on its surface, it appears to be from the late romantic period. A crystal box has been permenantly attached to the top of it.\n\nThe Elegant Pedestal contains: a Crystal Box. \n",
    "\nAtop an ornate pedestal to the right of the throne sits an intricate crystal box. The crystal panels are heavily leaded and skillfully carved such that you're unable to tell what may lie within. There is a silver keyhole on the front of the crystal box that glitters brilliantly in the otherwise dark and brooding room. The top of the crystal box is engraved with calligraphy. The crystal box appears to be permanently affixed to the elegant pedestal but is in easy reach of anyone sitting upon the throne.\n\nThe Crystal Box is closed. On the Crystal Box you see: Calligraphy. \n",
    "\nThe Crystal Box is locked.\n",
    "\n'The Kinging Scroll'\n",
    "\nThe silver keyhole glitters brilliantly in the otherwise dark and brooding throne room. So much so that it reminds you of the polished luster of the shiny sword.\n",
