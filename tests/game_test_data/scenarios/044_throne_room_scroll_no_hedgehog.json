    "\nOpenned. The Paper Bag contains: a Baked Biscuit. \n",
    "\nWith a yelp of grateful delight the starving hedgehog leaps upon the Baked Biscuit and begins to devour them.\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is ravenously devouring the Stale Biscuits and is taking no notice of you at all.\n",
    "\nTaken\n\nYour score is now 20 out of 75\n\nWith the Shiny Sword in hand you are now armed and dangerous!\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog has eaten through half the Stale Biscuits but is still giving them all of its attention.\n\nYour sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.\n",
    "\n*** Entrance ***\n\nThe following items are here: a Big Rock. \n\nYour sword is no longer glowing.\n",
    "\nWith courage and boldness to spare you leap from the drawbridge into the murky waters of the Moat. A less resolute adventurer might have turned tail at the sight of the oncoming giant crocodile but not you Burt. Treading water with your feet you take a two-handed grip on the shiny sword (now blazing so brightly it appears engulfed in blue flame) and get ready to face your destiny. Just before reaching you the primitive reptile realizes that you are armed and ready to fight (crocs are famously near-sighted). In surprise and fear it belches up the contents of it's stomach - including the Royal Crown - and flees in fear. With a deft athleticism unlike anything you've ever displayed before today you stow the shiny sword, snag the Royal Crown before it sinks, and in one smooth motion adroitly hoist yourself back onto the drawbridge one handed. The lads at the pub would fall over at the sight of your skill and courage! (though mind you, they fall over on a regular basis as it is)\n\nWith the Shiny Sword no longer in hand, you are a bit more approachable.\n",

    "\n(with the Shiny Sword)\n\nYou attack with the Shiny Sword and the Guard Goblin attempts to parry with the Grimy Axe!\n\nThe Shiny Sword surges with power and lethal heft in your hand. A preternatural calm comes over you. You were born for this moment. Your raucous pub crawling days were a mere temporary distraction. You know in your bones that this primal showdown was meant to be and that, with the Shiny Sword at your command, you were meant to win it. Resolute, and with a confidence you have never even imagined having up until this very moment, you stride forward to meet your foe in battle.\n\nThe Shiny Sword swings through the air with a blazing-fast assault. The Guard Goblin is slain by the blazing-fast strike! \n\nYour score is now 35 out of 75\n\nYour sword is no longer glowing.\n",

    "\n(with the Grimy Axe)\n\nDon't say I didn't warn you burt...\n\nYou attack with the Grimy Axe and the Royal Hedgehog attempts to parry with the Shiny Sword!\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog squeeks in dismay as it dodges your malevolent agression. It's loyal gaze changes to one of bewilderment and hearbreak. 'Et tu Burtus?' Even as the loyal little creature gives way, you know in your heart that you will come to regret this unkingly deed.\n\nThe Grimy Axe arcs through the air with a lightening-fast stroke. The Royal Hedgehog is terrirfied and flees from the unprovoked attack. \n\nYour score is now 30 out of 75\n",

    "\nTaken\n\nYour score is now 35 out of 75\n\nWith the Grimy Axe no longer in hand, you are a bit more approachable.\n",
    "\nWow this thing is fancy! Huge letters with little pictures inside them and all sorts of curvy flourish at the end of each and every letter. Burt, your humble biscuit-baking, pub-crawling brain doesn't even know what to call this thing but if it did you would call it an illuminated manuscript composed (of course) of illuminated letters. Thanks to the hard and thankless work of your first grade teacher, Ms. Lusk, you could probably just manage to read the illuminated letters.\n\nOn the Kinging Scroll you see: Illuminated Letters. \n",
    "\nFirst with great effort and then, surprisingly, with surety and confidence, you read out loud the text on the scroll. Your voice booms forth of its own accord - as if some part of your brain has been getting ready to say these words all your life. The rest of brain is struggling just to make sense of what you're saying with such confidence... it seems to be something along the lines of a recipe with ingredients... so if the 'heir to the true king' (whoever that might be)... reads 'this precious parchment'(you're pretty sure that means the scroll you're holding)... in the Throne Room (you've been there!)... while 'adorned with the gleaming headpiece of state and seated upon our royal cathedra' (whatever that means)... and also requiring that 'so long as the castle remains invested with a representative of our most noble heraldic charge seen ever upon our crest, seal, and glorious coat of arms' (even Ms. Lusk would have no clue what this means but she would notice that an awful lot of the illuminated letters in this sentence include a hedgehog with a sword and a key)... and then it finishes on a rather dramatic high note with the words 'upon the hour these conditions be met, a new King of Bright Castle shall shine forth and be proclaimed!'\n\nUpon reading the kinging scroll aloud, there is a rumble and a bright flash of light in the sky.. but then it dims and the sound fades. Alas, some vital ingredient has gone missing in the castle... this is grim Burt... you may need to start your adventures over from the start and play through with a more benevolent spirit.\n",
