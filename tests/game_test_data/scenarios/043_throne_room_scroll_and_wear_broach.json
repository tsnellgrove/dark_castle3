    "\nOpenned. The Paper Bag contains: a Baked Biscuit. \n",
    "\nWith a yelp of grateful delight the starving hedgehog leaps upon the Baked Biscuit and begins to devour them.\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog is ravenously devouring the Stale Biscuits and is taking no notice of you at all.\n",
    "\nTaken\n\nYour score is now 20 out of 75\n\nWith the Shiny Sword in hand you are now armed and dangerous!\n\nThe Royal Hedgehog has eaten through half the Stale Biscuits but is still giving them all of its attention.\n\nYour sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.\n",

    "\n(with the Shiny Sword)\n\nYou attack with the Shiny Sword and the Guard Goblin attempts to parry with the Grimy Axe!\n\nThe Shiny Sword surges with power and lethal heft in your hand. A preternatural calm comes over you. You were born for this moment. Your raucous pub crawling days were a mere temporary distraction. You know in your bones that this primal showdown was meant to be and that, with the Shiny Sword at your command, you were meant to win it. Resolute, and with a confidence you have never even imagined having up until this very moment, you stride forward to meet your foe in battle.\n\nThe Shiny Sword swings through the air with a blazing-fast assault. The Guard Goblin is slain by the blazing-fast strike! \n\nYour score is now 25 out of 75\n\nYour sword is no longer glowing.\n",

    "\n*** Throne Room ***\n",
    "\nPulled.\n\nHoping to find some sort of secret compartment filled with gold - or at least a good souvenir to show to the lads back at the pub - you pull and prod the throne. As you are pulling the throne forward you hear a metallic 'clank' and something rolls out from beneath the throne.. it appears to be a hedgehog broach. It must have been wedged between the throne and the castle wall all these years... since the days of the last King! The sight of it brings back old memories... \n\nYou have a strong urge to examine the hedgehog broach more closely.\n",
    "\nTaken\n\nYour score is now 40 out of 75\n\nWith the Shiny Sword no longer in hand, you are a bit more approachable.\n",
    "\nWorn.\n\nThere's no sign of magical properties but you're confident that Nana would be glad to see the Hedgehog Broach being worn in the castle again after all these years. You pause and wonder if there are any lessons you can still learn from Nana's last words to you...\n",

    "\nYou cast an apraising inner eye and take stock: Manly rough-and-tumble good looks - check, Affable demeanor paired with self-depreciating humor - check!, A lifetime of finely-honed baking skills - check!! Yep - that's you Burt - A fine specimen of a man. If not for the belching, farting, and cussing I don't know how you'd ever manage to fend off the ladies!\n\nIn your off hand you hold a Brass Lantern.\n\nYou are holding a Silver Key. \n\nIn your backpack you have: a Cheese Wedge, a Paper Bag (empty), an Earthen Jug (containing a Well Water), a Rusty Key, and a Hedgehog Broach. \n",
    "\nThe small silver key glitters in the dim light. It certainly stands out in the otherwise dreary Dark Castle. If you find a glittering silver keyhole somewhere this is definitely the key for it!\n",

    "\nWow this thing is fancy! Huge letters with little pictures inside them and all sorts of curvy flourish at the end of each and every letter. Burt, your humble biscuit-baking, pub-crawling brain doesn't even know what to call this thing but if it did you would call it an illuminated manuscript composed (of course) of illuminated letters. Thanks to the hard and thankless work of your first grade teacher, Ms. Lusk, you could probably just manage to read the illuminated letters.\n\nOn the Kinging Scroll you see: Illuminated Letters. \n",

    "\n*** Antechamber ***\n\nThe following items are here: a Torn Note, a Grimy Axe, and a Big Medal. \n",
    "\nOn the Kinging Scroll, written in Illuminated Letters, you read: First with great effort and then, surprisingly, with surety and confidence, you read out loud the text on the scroll. Your voice booms forth of its own accord - as if some part of your brain has been getting ready to say these words all your life. The rest of brain is struggling just to make sense of what you're saying with such confidence... it seems to be something along the lines of a recipe with ingredients... so if the 'heir to the true king' (whoever that might be)... reads 'this precious parchment'(you're pretty sure that means the scroll you're holding)... in the Throne Room (you've been there!)... while 'adorned with the gleaming headpiece of state and seated upon our royal cathedra' (whatever that means)... and also requiring that 'so long as the castle remains invested with a representative of our most noble heraldic charge seen ever upon our crest, seal, and glorious coat of arms' (even Ms. Lusk would have no clue what this means but she would notice that an awful lot of the illuminated letters in this sentence include a hedgehog with a sword and a key)... and then it finishes on a rather dramatic high note with the words 'upon the hour these conditions be met, a new King of Bright Castle shall shine forth and be proclaimed!'.\n\nUpon reading the kinging scroll aloud you hear a distant rumble as if great powers are at work... but then it fades... perhaps you need to read it somewhere else to complete the recipe?\n",

    "\nWith courage and boldness to spare you leap from the drawbridge into the murky waters of the Moat. A less resolute adventurer might have turned tail at the sight of the oncoming giant crocodile but not you Burt. Treading water with your feet you take a two-handed grip on your weapon and get ready to face your destiny. Just before reaching you the primitive reptile realizes that you are armed and ready to fight (crocs are famously near-sighted). In surprise and fear it belches up the contents of it's stomach - including the Royal Crown - and flees in fear. With a deft athleticism unlike anything you've ever displayed before today you stow your weapon, snag the Royal Crown before it sinks, and in one smooth motion adroitly hoist yourself back onto the drawbridge one handed. The lads at the pub would fall over at the sight of your skill and courage! (though mind you, they fall over on a regular basis as it is)\n\nWith the Grimy Axe no longer in hand, you are a bit more approachable.\n",

By the scroll's power the castle is scourgafied and all that was once dark is now glimmering with color and ligtht. Where Dark Castle once lurked, now gleams Bright Castle! The stone coffer magically fills with gold (and also a conveniently provided and legally complete deed to Bright Castle). And suddenly Burt, you find your own somewhat threadbare Baker's clothing replaced by garments of rich velvet and silk. Moments later, the Royal Hedgehog scampers into the Throne Room, places the silver sword at your feet, and kneels in fealty. Well done Burt! To the amazement of your family and friends - and the eternal pride of your great grandmother, Nana - you are now the King of Bright Castle!!\n\nYou have won!\n\nYour adventure ended after 45 moves.\n\nYour score is now 75 out of 75\n\nYour title is: Burt the Bold, King of Bright Castle\n\nThe Dark Castle game was written and programmed by Tom. Thanks to Toby, Joshua, JoyEllen, Milo, Gideon, Franco, Karl, Andy, Ken and Alec for advice and playtesting!!\n"
