[Dark Castle]

'hedgehog_broach':
    "The silver Hedgehog Broach is about an inch in diameter and is carved with the crest of a hedgehog bearing a sword and a key. It's strangely familiar... you've seen one just like it... long ago... examining the Hedgehog Broach up close triggers a long forgotten memory...
    
    you were only five or six years old... you and all your family were at the bedside of your great grandmother, Nana Baker. She was old - very, very old - so old no even was sure how old - not even Nana. She'd been unable to eat or get out of bed for the past week and the village healer had given his solemn verdict that at long last her time had come. The whole village had come round to pay their last respects but now it was just family left. She looked very tired and her eyes were closed.
    
    'Thomas', said Nana, meaning your father, 'I'm weary... be a good lad and go heat me some tea... Nice and hot please.'. Next she sent your mother off for a special pillow she'd loaned to a friend. Soon every member of the family was off on an errand and it was just you and Nana.
    
    Quite suddenly, Nana's eyes opened, bright blue and wide awake. 'Well, Burty, finally we can have a little chat. I wish you were a bit older but now will have to do. Tell me Burty, how do ya feel about baking biscuits?'
    
    'It's na so bad' you'd stammered back.
    
    Nana laughed and gave you a warm smile. 'Don't feel bad Burty, I wasn't much of a Baker myself - had a bit of a wild romantic streak in me - just like you. You remind me so much of my Willy... and that's not entirely an accident mind you. Thought I might see a resemblance in your grandfather or father but they were mindful lads and happy enough to be Bakers. I guess it's waited for you to show itself. Probably just as well.'
    
    'Ah Willy... now don't get me wrong, Papa Baker was a good man - hard working and with a kind heart - took me hand when many others wouldn't have and always treated me good. But you're from different stock Burty, very different. And that comes with some responsibilities... you've got a destiny 'afore you and that can be hard on young man with no expecting of it. That's why I'm telling you this now.'
    
    'Your real great grandpa was Willy... William Herbert... last of the line of Flatheads... or so everyone's been told. He was a handsome man... like you Burty. And unlike the rest of his family - full of romance and laughter and travel and adventure. Could be a bit reckless at times but he had a good heart. He proposed to me right proper he did... didn't really have to... he was so high up in society... and so much older too... but the moment I told him he dropped right to one knee and popped the question. Didn't care the least what people said! Swore we'd elope if the high priest wouldn't marry us... and he would have too!'\n\n'Alas, that crazy man... four months before the big day he was wandering about the castle entrance, wearing his bathrobe and Royal Crown, smoking his pipe and reading a book as he walked, as usual, and boom, he trips on the drawbridge and falls right into the Moat! Eaten right up in one big bite by one of those mean old crocodiles that have swum in it forever. Oh the day I heard the news...' And with these words she touched the Hedgehog Broach she always wore over her heart. 'It was a dark day Burty, a dark day for me an' for the castle and all the lands around.'
    
    'Someday Burty William Baker, someday you'll be King. And when you is, you be a good King... a kind and courageous and bold king... and when you is King don't ya be going walking off the edge of the drawbridge with no weapon in your hands and breaking young girl's hearts - you hear me?'
    
    Stunned by this strange tale you began to stammer an answer but just then your Father returned with the hot tea. With a wink just for you, Nana's eyes closed again and she sank back into the bed. Minutes later she was gone.
    
    For years and years you wondered what she was talking about and eventually you began to doubt the conversation had ever even happened. Over time it had faded completely... but here in Dark Castle, with the Hedgehog Broach before you, the memory is clear and real. Nana was buried with her beloved broach - she had insisted on it. This must have been a matching mate - presumably worn by Willy himself."

'family_tree':
    "It appears to show the family tree of the Flathead dynasty. Though generally agreed to have peaked (nadired?) during the reign of Dimwit Flathead and petered out shortly there-after during the inglorious rulership of Wurb Flathead, this Family Tree tells a different story. It claims that a remote uncle of Wurb continued the line for seven more generations and eventually ended with William 'The Wanderer' Flathead only a little over 100 years ago. The area below William is indistinct and feels incomplete.. as if there are details still waiting to be filled in.\n\nAt the very top of the Family Tree you see a royal crest. Oddly enough, it appears to be a Hedgehog bearing a Shiny Sword and a Silver Key."

'guard_goblin_shiny_sword_burt_*':
    "The Shiny Sword surges with power and lethal heft in your hand. A preternatural calm comes over you. You were born for this moment. Your raucous pub crawling days were a mere temporary distraction. You know in your bones that this primal showdown was meant to be and that, with the Shiny Sword at your command, you were meant to win it. Resolute, and with a confidence you have never even imagined having up until this very moment, you stride forward to meet your foe in battle."

'moat_get_crown_result':
    "With courage and boldness to spare you leap from the drawbridge into the murky waters of the Moat. A less resolute adventurer might have turned tail at the sight of the oncoming giant crocodile but not you Burt. Treading water with your feet you take a two-handed grip on your weapon and get ready to face your destiny. Just before reaching you the primitive reptile realizes that you are armed and ready to fight (crocs are famously near-sighted). In surprise and fear it belches up the contents of it's stomach - including the Royal Crown - and flees in fear. With a deft athleticism unlike anything you've ever displayed before today you stow your weapon, snag the Royal Crown before it sinkes, and in one smooth motion adroitly hoist yourself back onto the drawbridge one handed. The lads at the pub would fall over at the sight of your skill and courage! (though mind you, they fall over on a regular basis as it is)"

[A Cup of Tea]

'cecily':
    "You give yourself a self-concious once-over: at age 19 and the youngest daughter of Ethan McGiggin, the prosperous owner of the town's only pub, you should be well on your way towards matrimony - but to your mother's dismay and your own deep gratitude, it appears to be nowhere on the horrizon. Of course you're also the more homely and introverted daughter - more fond of books than boys they say. Your older sister, Chrissy, the queen of the viallage, has always had a dozzen men at a time circling her in eratic orbits, moths to the flame - so who would ever notice you?",


*** How I got Here ***

Story History:
    Originally, there was no backstory. Just an unlikely hero named Burt, who was a bit of an oaf but a likable one. Evntually, as I got to the final puzzle, I felt a need to explain why Burt was in any way destined to be king. Also, I needed to give a hint as to how players could get the royal_crown - and thus was born the extensive hedgehog_broach monlouge - which I ended up quite liking. 

    Soon after, I got player feedback that more hinting was needed regarding how to get the silver_key. This led to the creation of the family_tree in the throne_room. Since Zork and Enchanter were such a powerful influences on the game, I decided to set Dark Castle in the same universe and make Willie (the last king) a likable member of the Flathead dynasty. This in turn led to updating the glass_bottle of water to match the earthen_jug from Enchanter.

    With these updates in mind, several key passages, such as Burt's victory over the guard_goblin and his acquisition of the royal_crown, were updated to imply a bit of a destiny. 

    Also, over time, the backstory has evolved. Originally, as can be seen from the hedgehog_broach passage, I had intended Burt to be a reluctant Baker. Sort of cut out for bigger things but baking because he was born to it. But over time, I've come to have a real affection for Burt's baking background. So now I have the idea knocking around in my head that he got his baking skills from Nana (who actually taught him some baking as well) and his adverntureous streak from Willie.
    
    Also, unbidden, the idea for a seqel came to me (daunting, given how far I am from finishing the main work!) in which Burt goes back in time to save a princess (perhaps named Tabitha) from a foreign land who has somehow become imprissoned in Bright Castle after Willie's death and just before it's fall into Dark Castle (enabling a brief face-to-face with a much younger Nana who recognizes Burt from his biscuit insignia). The idea is that perhaps Burt has a bit of a crush on the princess - who in turn teaches Burt some important lessons and also by the by has the ability to change into a cat - but likely needs to deal with some local issues (initially, she had to go home to help her father who was in ill health) to avoid any sort of fascile rescue-the-princess-to-get-marriage-reward ending.

    And finally, when building out a second mini-adventure to test the Cleesh Engine with, I invented Cecily (who maybe I will rename Tiffany after the heroine of Wee Free Men? Or perhaps Catherine - after my youngest?), the bookish youngest daughter of the village pub owner - who was destined to be Burt's true love (after he's learned some important life lessons from princess Tabitha). 
    
    So now there's a bit of a backstory - but it's rather sprawling and patchwork. And I have a lot of quiestions to answer. What local village profession / expectation is baking supposed to be in contrast to? And for that matter, what exactly did happen to Bright Castle that brought it crashing into the disrepair of Dark Castle? And who exactly is Burt and what does he want? And if Nana really passed when Burt was 5 or 6, how much baking could she have taught him (maybe he was 8 or 9 instead?)?


*** Rough Notes on Narrative Ideas ***

Tactical Ideas:
    - IDEA: is Burt a true baker following in the footsteps of Nana? (lean this way)
    - IDEA: or is baking something he's not really cut out for?
    - IDEA: maybe Willy's middle name was Herbert?
    - IDEA: update lantern and sword to match Zork
    - IDEA: add loaf of bread from Enchanter

Updated Backstory Outline:
    Willie & Nana:
        An adventureous spirit and a beautiful, cozy-making baker born for each other
        Inspiration for Nana includes the love interst from "Stranger than Fiction"
        Update Willie's middle name to Herbert (Burt's namesake)
        After Willie's passing, Nana took the hand of the castle copiest to avoid ruin
        Both escaped to the local village before the fall; Nana hid her baking skills to avoid recognition
    Bright Castle Becomes Dark Castle:
        Something about an evil prince and the transformation of minions into animals???
    Nana & Burt:
        Nana recognized Burt's true heritage from a very young age
        Burt was dyslexic and never took to coppying. 
        Over his parent's objections, Nana supported Burt's inclination to bake and taught him skills
    Burt Today (goals and love interests and such):
        Burt is a lovable mess of unfulfilled potential
        He has a starry-eyed crush on Cecily's pretty older sister but in reality relates much better to Cecily
        He has a low opinion of himself due to his bad handwriting and not meeting parent's expectations
        He will need to learn more from the princess on both these fronts
        Burt is naturally good with his hands and loves the outdoors (vs. the confines of the coppiest chamber)
        Burt (when not brawling) gets along well with others and is affible and easy going; not stuck up
        Burt's father (Thomas) is a 3rd generation coppiest and dreams that in 1 or 2 more gens one of his offspring will achieve the title of scribe! And perhaps in many years to come, a scrivener!! (/sarcasm)
    Reference Objects:
        earthen_jug
        fresh-baked_biscuit
        elven_sword
            need to fix those dwarven_runes; perhaps funny dyslexic read from Burt: "Woblin Gallaper"
            should glow near the goblin?
        loaf_of_bread
        brass_lantern (but maybe not battery powered? That's always bothered me)
    Minion opponents in Dark Castle - who and why?

Rough Notes / Ideas:
- Willie is the Adventure from Zork I!
- Willie dies via genunie accident but the power vacuum tempts Krill, out of hiding
- Krill (the evil Warlock from Enchanter) is the ultimate source of Dark Castle's ruin
- Incompetent minions tempted by jealousy / desire / averice / venality; behind the scenes, corrupted by Krill
- The former (evil) Steward becomes the Guard Goblin
- Goblin as broad satire of small-minded, provincial conservatism: tradition, xenophobia, ignorance, "research"
- The former (evil) High Priest becomes a Vampire
- Krill as satire of Trump (orange skin, fake hair, upside down holly book, "Goblins First")
- But need to avoid getting too serious; keep the silly and quirky vibe
- The minions uses dark magic (provided by Krill) to corrupt the castle and transform inhabitants into animals
- Durring DC2, Krill is revealed as the source of the corruption and the minions are transformmed...,
- But the curse is not reversed (due to Krill still being in power, etc)

Narrative Goals:
- Need a poetic tragedy
- Need to flesh out characters
- How does guard goblin become the ultimate "local" villain?

*** Detailed Narrative ***

The Last of the Flatheads:
    William Herbert Flathead (also known as "Willie the Wanderer") was born... 

Willie's Reign:
    Willie arrived at "High Castle" soon after gaining the Twenty Treasures of Zork. At the time, High Castle was an outpost of the GUE and had been under stewardship ever since the empire's fall 65 years earlier. The Steward, the eldest son of High Castle's first steward and equal measures entitled and insecure in his reign, would doubtless have been intimidated by Willie's prowers and fame alone. But when Willie visited the castle courtyard - with the withered tree and waterless fountain - both destined to be barren until the return of the Flathead line - the Fountain errupted in a gyzer of water and the Tree burst forth in leaf and fruit. Thus Willie's heritage was revealed and (to his great surprise) he was proclaimed King on the spot by the acclimation of the populace. The Steward could only look on, stripped of his station, glowering with impotent rage and envy. And while the people loved Willie from the start, the Steward was not alone in his displeasure. The High Priest was also in a state of silent, vindictive furry.

    Willie was an open-hearted man of the people. He came from the streets himself and felt a bond with the less fortunate. He saw that the Steward's taxes - and the High Priets tithes - on the poor were far too high - and that the nobility were nearly untaxed. Uncaring of the tax impact on himself (he was likely the richest man of the land at the time) he rewrote the tax code to shift the burden. He was also a huge believer in education and the notion that any man - or woman - could "pull themselves up by thar bootstraps". He noted that the treasury was already healthy (though not as healthy as it should have been given the tax rates) and spent liberally to provide education and opportunity for all. He was also a fair handed man by nature and thus put a stop to curruption wherever he came across it. Perhaps most distressing to the Steward and the High Priest, Willie was not just a man of the people - he was a man of *all* people. He renamed "High Castle" to "Bright Castle" and threw open the gates to all. He embraced Elven minstrals and Dwarven craftsmen alike as full citizens and supported the arts generously. It was the golden era of Bright Castle. There was music and joy in the streets and it was said that every day felt like festival day. And yet, like so many golden ages, it was to last just a briefly.

    Willie was at least mildly aware that he was up-ending the order of things and therefore likely upsetting the previous standard bearers. He did his best to maintain at least civil relations with the Steward (who he made the new Sherif) and the High Priest (with whom he shared power as best he could under the notion of separation of church and state) - but to no avail. In truth, he - and the kingdom - might have been better off had Willie simply thrown them both in the dungeons - but then he likely could not have been the beacon of light that he was had that been his practice. 
    
    The Steward and High Priest were deeply offended by Willie's liberal ways and incensed that their own powers had been circumscribed. But beyond policy and ideology, for both men, it was personal. The Steward, a vain and small minded man who, even when in power, had been defensive of his position and accutely sensitive to any slight, would be forever vengeful for his loss of office. In taut whispered tones he spoke of Willie as a fraudulent usurper to those he trusted. And the High Priest had his own dark reasons for wrath. For some years he'd had his lustful and letcherous eye on the beautiful young baker who sang so sweetly, in such pure notes, in the church choir. But she was wilful and stuborn and swore that no man would rule her. The High Priest searched daily for a means of entrapment but under Willie's rule, his means were limited. Three years into Willie's rule, it became clear that Willie and the young woman were meant for each other. And less than a year later, Willie informed the High Priest that, in total disregard of church tradition, he planned to wed her publically. The High Priest's jealousy knew no bounds. Secretly, nightly, the he and the Steward prayed at the church's alter for Willie's demise.

Willie and Nana's Courtship:
    Depsite their considerable age gap, Willie and Nana, known then as Miss Tiffany Baker, were simply made for each other. He was decisive, gruff, open-hearted, and pragmatic. She was kind, idealistic, empathic, and, fearless. Where Willie made right by the sword, Nana made right through her baking. They met at the Spring Festival which happened to also be Nana's 21st birthday. What started as good natured bartering over the price of baked goods (where Willie was immediately taken to meet the only stallkeeper willing to demand full price from the King) turned into a wide-ranging, evening-long discussion on favorite books, economic policy, and the correct way in which to eat jumble crab pie (Nana was incredulous that Willie would use a new-fangled fork rather than a spoon). Their first conversation was, for the most part, an extended debate. Anyone watching (and many were) would have anticipated the evening ending with either Willie being slapped or Nana being tossed into the dungeons. But in truth, each of them came away from the night intrigued - they were each forces of nature who had not before then met their match. 
    
    Willie tracked down Nana's baking shop the next day. He claimed to have developed an addiction to her biscuits (which were, indeed, renowned throughout the land) but also declared that he wanted to clarify a few of his points from the the night before... and so the conversation continued. What began as mutual curiousity soon turned into mutual enchantment and before long a deep and abiding love. Willie, who had intended to depart Brigh Castle within a year, suddenly found himself ready to settle down if Bright Castle was where Nana wanted to stay. And Nana, who had never included a man in any of her life plans, found that she was ready to reshape those plans to make room for Willie.

    Some months later, Nana came to Willie's chambers and told him in a fierce but vulnerable voice, that she was pregnant and prepared to depart Bright Castle and make her way in the outlands, annonymously and on her own. Instead, he burst into tears of joy, embraced her, and then dropped to one knee to propose marriage. Shyly, and with tears of her own, she accpeted. Willie announced the engagement publically the very next morning (not thinking to mention it to the High Priest till several days later) and the kingdom celebrated the news with joy (in truth, Willie and Nana were the last to learn that they were to be wed - the rest of the land had already known for some time).

Krill's Evil Plans:
    Alas, Willie's reign - and the happiness of Nana and all the land - was cut tragically short by a random accident involving a mis-step off the drawbridge while unarmed (Willie had been meaning to see about the moat crocodiles but had never gotten around to it). Ever since, there have been attempts to attribute his death to foul play but none of these theories has ever stood up to scrutiny. By all appearances, he simply, regretably, slipped.

    But while Willie's death itself may have been a genuine accident, what followed in its wake was evil of the first degree. The Steward and High Priest were delighted by Willie's demise. At long last, their nightly prayers were answered and they were freed from Willie's "tyrany". Surely, if left to their own devices, they would have returned to their old ways and likely thought up a few new petty injustices to boot. But things were to take a dark turn. The very night of Willie's death, as the Steward and the High Priest were drinking brandy and cackling over thier good fortune in the empty chappel, the dark warlock Krill himself appeared before them - radiating with power and might - and blocking their path to the chappel's double doors. The Steward and High Priest were terrified and scanned the room frantically for means of escape or a hiding spot. To their amazement, Krill meekly knelt before them, and with open arms and humble tones implored them "Your magesties, I come to beseach of you a boon." At this time, Krill was still young and handsome of appearance and spoke with an echoing voice that was hard indeed to say no to. It is doubtful that mere mortals such as the Steward and High Priest could have denied his wishes had they tried - but the test was not made. Krill had only to stroke their bruised egos and without hesitation they readily acquiesced.

    Then it was that Krill unfolded a plan of deepest darkness to the weak and wretched mortals. He suggested clever means by which their heart's desires could be theirs. And in return, he asked only that they conduct "a small and simple ritual" - which he promised would assure them of the respect and position they were rightly due. The passage of history would prove this moment to be Krill's undoing. He was not yet at full strength and was unwise to unviel his presence to the Circle so soon - yet the power vacuum presented an unexpected opportunity. Bright Castle stood well distant from the remote castle of Lonely Mountain where Krill had begun to amass his forces. If he could corrupt Bright Castle and make it a second seat of power, he could assult the Circle on two fronts - and perhaps smash through their defenses before they knew he was upon them. Krill, never one to doubt his own cleverness, gave in to the temptation - and this would prove to be his undoing. But though his gamble would prove to be his folly, so to was it the ruin of Bright Castle. The Steward and High Priest never thought twice about granting Krill's requests. They thanked him profusely for his wise and cunning counsil and followed his instructions to the letter.

    The next day the Steward announced publically that he had incontrovertable evidence that Nana was Willie's assasin. He re-siezed his full Steward powers and declared martial law. His first action was to have to have Nana thrown into the dungeons, still dressed in black and in deep mourning - with a trial to follow "when time and prudence allowed". His second action was to have Bright Castle renamed back to it's "proper and respected" title of High Castle. Last but not least, he sent a speedy messenger to his nearest neighbor and sought an immediate bond of marriage with their youngest daughter - the Princess Saffron - known to be sickly in her youth and little seen since - but said now to be both beautiful and obedient. The missive was blunt - the Steward was pursuing High Castle's interests first and was placing a premium on loyalty. Send the Princess or expect a seige. The little nation had hitherto looked on Bright Castle as an ally and a  protector. They had no means to resist assult - and so rather than have her ripped from the castle by force of arms, they submitted and sent the Princess Saffron speedily back with the messenger (on a fresh horse) that very same day.

    Later the same day, the High Priest, seated on the chappel throne, dressed in his most radient robes, and clutching his bejeweled golden scepter, had Nana brough before him upon her knees. He told her that he had an understanding with the Steward and was willing to open his heart and absolve her of her many sins if she would swear a life-long vow of service to the church and willingly perform regular acts of penance to his satisfaction. Here the narrative takes a turn. Exactly what followed is uncertain but the High Priest seems to have miscalculated. Perhaps he was a somewhat too smug. Perhpas he was naive in having Nana's shackles removed and the guards dismissed. All that is known for sure is that Nana did not join the oder and the guards standing at the door were wholly unprepared to halt the lithe figure that lept through the chappel's stained glass window. And in any case, they were far too busy rushing to the aid of the High Priest who was bent double and yelping, whimpering, and cursing in a most un-priestly fashion regarding exactly where and how hard he'd been struck by the golden scepter.

A Summoning Gone Wrong and the Fall of Bright Castle:
    Krill's intentions are well understood. He sought to Summon a deamon and sacrifice Princess Saffron to it as part of a dark bargain to secretly convert Bright Castle into hist second seat of his power. This did indeed nearly came to pass - the demon was summoned - and Princess Saffron vanished completely, never to be seen or heard from again - but somewhere along the way, Krill's plan went dreadfully awry. 
    
    For reasons unknown, the ritual was disruptied, the bargain was not sealed, and the demon was forced to return from whence it came. But in its brief moment on this plane - furious at the promise that was made but not kept - the demon spat out a horrible spell: it cursed all in Bright Castle to have their darkest traits revealed in their very being for ever after.

    Thankfully, the vast majority of the castle's inhabitants were out of the castle at the time assisting in puting out a barn fire. But those that remained, the Steward, the High Priest, and a number of others, were transformed into monsterous countanences of thier worst natures. It is said that Krill himself, who had been leading the ritual, was the most horribly transformed - his previously handsome features turned hideous - his skin made orange and his hair turned unnatural and wretched to look upon. The very castle itself was corrupted and took on a grim and foreboding aspect. All who could fled Dark Castle's shadow and settled in the small village nestled behind a hill and across the stream some miles away. 

    But the demise of Dark Castle was to be the salvation of the surrounding lands. By means still not fully understood, Enchantress Tabitha was made immediately aware of Krill's attempted summoning. Tabitha was  one of the leading lights of the Circle of Enchanters and, according to some, the true force behind Belboz's long and illustrious legacy. Within the hour of Dark Castle's fall she summoned the Circle to annunce Krill's return and his evil intentions. Belboz himself has long been credited with the unconventional (though in hindsight, brilliant) plan to send a little-known novice to conforont Krill within the dark warlock's Lonely Mountain castle. Yet a number of those present in the Circle privately attest that it was Tabitha who, citing an ancient and little-known prophesy, proposed this plan and then, on the spot, chose and called forth the humble novice. Whomever the driving force within the Circle may have been, the strategem worked brilliantly and the Krill was routed in full.

    It is also, perhaps, notable that Enchantress Tabitha ever after took a keen interest in the revival of Dark Castle. Indeed, it is beleived that after years of research she had finally found a way to lift the curse and was, in fact, on the verge of doing so when the tumultuous events of the Spellbreaker saga came to pass and the era of magic - and mgaic itself - was ended. Defeated, in her intentions, with what power remained to her, the great Enchantress made one last prophesy: that someday a scion of Willie the Wanderer would rise and free Dark Castle from the curse, whence Bright Castle would again shine forth as a beacon of goodness across the land.

Nana's Flight and the Legacy of Dark Castle:
    The demon's curse was of such power that it's coming was visible to all. The sky went black and roiled. The heavens rumbled. And then forks of lightening barelled down from the heavens - striking the chappel steeple and the brilliant stained glass windows of the the castle's once-glorious throne room. 

    All present threw themselves to the ground in terror. And when the sky had ceased to roil (for it never again fully cleared right above Dark Castle) the castle's very stones had blackened - as if coated in soot - and the vile smell of brimstone wafted from the once-welcoming front gate.
 
    The populace stared in mute, stunned horror. Willie's death just the day before had been a mighty blow to many - but it had at least been a comprehenible loss - and after words of grief, talk turned to how the kingdom would move on. These events were beyond ken and past common understanding. For a time the populace simply stood rooted - awaiting the next blow to finish them all.
    
    Nana was, perhaps, the first to recover. In the minutes after the curse she seemed to have aged at least a decade. And though she herself never spoke of that day again, it was said in later years that that was the day she "got wise". 
    
    There in the afterglow of the just extinguished barn, she turned to Thomas the Coppiest besides her - who was still holding a full bucket of water and staring open-mouthed at the chappel's cracked steeple - and said "Mr. Coppiest, I don't love ya but I like ya - and if you'll have me, I'll be yours. And together we'll find a way to make a life." She spoke softly and earnestly, for Thomas' ears alone, but the murmor of her voice broke the oppresive silence and slowly the towns folk regained themselves.

    Thomas was a widower in his early fifties - an advanced age back then for those neither royal or holly. Since her late teen years he'd often had a shy glance and a kind word for her - but not such as to give alarm.  He was not the sullen, angry sort that stalked his obsesions with lust and dreams of owning them. Rather, he was an open book - inescablably aware of young Nana's spirit and beauty - and also self-aware of and half-amused by his own happles doting. He was able to enjoy his time in her presence without seeking to rule it.

    Hearing Nans's words, Thomas came to his senses, closed his mouth, put down his bucket, took her hand, and dropped to one knee. "I would have ye, Miss Baker, and I count myself a lucky man. I'll do all I can to treat ya right and make our days sunny and long." And so their lives were joined. Nana smiled, pulled him to his feet, kissed him gently, and said "Then let's go make us a life." 

    And so they did. It was Nana, with Thomas in tow, who gathered up the leading craftsmen of the village - the miller, the blacksmith, the weaver, and others - and exhorted them all to get marching to the nearby village before night took fell. Her voice was kind but firm and one by one they came to grips with their new existence and rallied their fellow townsfolk to pick up what they could carry and march towards a new future. 
    
    For Nana it was not to be the life she had imagined - but it was not a bad life either - as she would often say herself. For one thing, Nana's talents were in great demand as there was a mighty need for baking in the newly, much expanded village. Thomas, for his part, was not just a good man, but a good partner too. He often minded the ovens through the night (baking being more needed in those early days than coppying) and learned the trade as best he could. In turn, Nana set to schooling on the strange art of coppying. This was her first time being exposed to reading - real reading of words bigger than four letters and writ longer than a cryer's plank - and she took to it like a bee to a bloom. There were still many then not fond of seeing a woman with a page but Thomas took delight in her love of words, taught her all he could, and brought to her a steady stream of text from anywhere he could lay hold of it. 
    
    Soon enough, Nana became the note taker at the weekly town council. And though she had no official voice of her own in the meeting, she understood that the pen-holder wields a mighty power of their own. The history she took down was generally the wisest version of what had been said in the room and often steered the ship of state: "Now I'm sorry your honors - everyone was speaking at once and Mr. Blacksmith was a banging on the meeting table and I couldn't quite get it all - now what exactly was it that Mr. Weaver was saying before it got so loud?". Initially, some of those in the meeting with the most booming voices were dour about Nana's "interfeering ways"... but the meetings did go a great deal more smoothly with her taking notes... and also, Nana always brought a plate of her famous biscuits - and no one coudld gainsay those. Soon enough, the council found excuses to not meet whenever Nana was sick our absent with child. After a generation, it was simply called "Town Meeting with Nana" and it was assumed she'd run it from the start. And so, not from a grand hall as she had once imagined, but in a humble thatch village, word-by-word, biscuit-by-biscuit, Nana led the town to a brighter future.

Time Passes:
    Busy as those early times were, Nana looked for signs of Willie in her firstborn, Liam (named, she swore, after a beloved uncle) but none were to be found. Liam was a cheerful and helpful tyke who learned his letters early and was happy to spend all day in the coppiest chamber mixing and refilling ink pots with his father. Despite Thomas' age, Nana bore him three children, all girls who were apt and pretty and made good matches for themselves in the now growing village. 
    
    Liam eventually married his childhood sweetheart, Anna, and soon they too started a family. Thomas lived just long enough to see the first of his grandchildren arrive and died with love in his heart and gratitude for the life he'd been given. Nana, though burdened with grief (over time Nana had come to care for Thomas and his gentle, kind ways quite deeply) kept a watchfull eye on her grandchildren any signs of Willie's temperment but to no avail. She adored them all but but it was a family of six young coppiests - all of them girls - who also did quite well for themselves - four marrying well and two teaming up to start their own coppiest shop in the village - the first woman owned and run shop in town. Then late in life, later than anyone expected, a seventh child arrived, a boy. He too seemed a born coppiest but again, for the sake of her "uncle" Nana gently put her finger on the scales and the boy was named Billy. 

    Years passed, and Nana quietly oversaw the workings of the village - as it grew to be a thriving little hamlet and, eventually, a full-fledged town. When she'd been married to Thomas she'd been known as Mrs. Coppiest-Baker - but now she was simply known to all as Nana. She was the heart of the town - watching over the comings and goings like a mother hen, quietly taking notes in the weekly town meetings for more than forty years. She still baked biscuits, smiled often, and listend with care - but she was beginning to worry that time would not grant her a chance to look upon Willie's successor.

    Eventually young Billy grew up and married a bright young woman named Esme from afar. She was an immagrent from the southlands with long hair and eyes so bright they startled. Some muttered unkindly that she must have some Elf in her but Nana embraced her new granddaughter-in-law with open arms and those who cast aspersions were quick to learn that kindly old Nana still had a sharp tongue in her head when she had a mind to use it. Soon Billy and Esme began their own family and, once agin, it was daughter after daughter - most of them drawn to coppiest work like their father but all of them also bearing their mother's startlingly bright eyes.

    Nana was delighted if a bit bewildered by this generation. They were bold and fearless - only two seemed keen to follow in their father's footsteps as coppiests and none were in a rush to marry. More than once - as she was about to speak up and suggest that Billy impose a smidgen of order on his brood - she recalled that she herself had once been all these things - and so she smiled and held her tongue, hugged more, baked more, and scolded less.

    And then, again late in life, a seventh child arrived. Sadly Esme was not well. A dark illness had taken her late in her term and where once she had been the light and beating heart of the family, she now struggled through each day. For the sake of the babe in her womb, Esme clung to life as a mountineer clings to a rocky cliff - second-by-second, minute-by-minute, grim but unyielding. By sheer will she made it, and the child, a boy, was born healthy and strong - but childbirth took the very last of Esme's strength and she passed the next day. Billy was inconsolable with grief. Even had he known how to raise a child - an art he'd left fully in Esme's hands - he'd have been in no state. So Nana, for the first time in nearly 70 years, closed up her baking shop - and took the task of raising young Burt into her own aged but loving hands.

Burt's Childhood:
    From an early age Nana spotted an adventuresome streak in young Burt. He hated the coppiest chamber and would run outdoors the moment his father took his eyes off him. And he loved working with his hands. He would dig in mud, climb trees, and build "castles" out of rocks all day if allowed, in all weather too. Young Burty, as Nana called him, reveled in conditions that made hardened farmers bolt the shutters fast. 
    
    His Father, Billy, was apt to be hard on Burt. First there was the matter of Esme's death - which Billy could never quite separate in his mind from Burt's arrival. Also, Billy was ambitious in a small way. Billy had had great expectations when at last a son had come along. Having come from five generations of coppiests he dreamed that Burt might become a church or even royal scribe. As time passed, it became clear that this would not come to pass. Not only was it impossible to keep the child at the task, but when he was firmly set down to the work and watched, Burt was awful at it. He always reached for the quill with his left hand - no matter how many times his Father scolded him on the matter - and when he did finally get to coppying, the rerults were mis-spelled and illegible. In a different time and place, a kind hearted teacher might have recognized in Burt some common learning disabilities and offered some work-arounds. But in a small village where your family profesion was your future and your name, Burt's lack of penmanship was no small practical matter. And to his father, it was simply disasterous.

    But Nana's eyes could see little Burtie's streths as well as his flaws - and her heart saw the sterak of her beloved Willie within him - and so she took him under her protective wing. 
    
    One afternoon when Burt was about five and had run off from his coppying work (again) Billy fumed to Nana "That boy will never amount to the least of coppyiest - I can't even trust him to refill an ink pot!"

    "Billy, you're right - it's not his calling - but he'd make a fine baker."

    "Bah - we've three baker's in town already and it's low manual work - barely even a craft. And besides, craft that it is, whose going to teach it to him, I'll ask you?!" declaraed Billy in frustration (Nana had closed up shop in her seventies, when Billy was not yet ten, so the memory was distant for him).

    "I will." said Nana. She rose and called Burt from his play in the woods and showed him to the back room where the old ovens stood dormant. And from that day forward, Nana was both mother and master.

    Burt thrived Under Nana's wing. He loved baking and had a natural talent for it. He spent many happy hours kneeding dough, stirring batter, and tending to the ovens. Nana also introduced him to reading - which Burt took to much more readily than copying - and he soon became an avid - if diffident reader of whater text he could gat ahold of. Nana also encouraged Burt's vigor and wanderlust. She put him to work chopping wood and hauling well water for several elderly neighbors, sent him into the forrest to gather all manner of ingredients (after first teaching him how to navigate in the wild), and, to Burt's amazement and delight, taught him to box sufficiently well that the local bullies gave their lane a wide birth.

    In short, Burt's life had gone from a daily dread of copying work and the low opinion of his father, to a daily delight in baking, reading, and rambling. The proudest moment of his life was when, on his ninth birthday, Nana taught Burt the recipie for her biscuits - a secret she had shared with no one else except Burt. But in the midst of Burt's joy, there was a hard truth that was becoming harder to ignore... Nana was, at long last, growing old. People had been saying she was "getting on" for some years already - though they didn't often say it in front of Burt, at least not more than once, because he was apt to charge at them with a furry that could knock even stout and hardy souls to the ground. But it was true. No one knew how old Nana was - not even Nana - but time was catching up with her. She would sometimes repeat herself or forget what she was saying half way through. And for the first time, her eyes looked tired.

    Nana died just three months after Burt's ninth birthday. She passed on the evening of the Spring Festival, 84 years to the day since the King of Bright Castle spent the night negotiating with her regarding the price of baked goods. She died with her eyes closed, a peaceful smile on her face, and in her final hour did her best to console and council her favorite great grandson - but young Burt was inconsolable. He wept for days. Strove about the forest wailing for hours. And leapt on anyone who so much as looked his way.

    After a fortnight, Billy sat Burt down, gave him the best pep talk he could muster, and told him it was time to return to the coppiest's chamber. Burt looked has Father (who was kneeling at the time) in the eye, put a hand on his shoulder, and said "Pa, I'm a Baker. So baking's what I'm going to do." And after wiping a final tear from his eye, that what he did.

Burt as a Young Man:


- [IDEA] story of Burt, born to bake and adventure but trapped in coppiest expectations
- [IDEA] finalize on Cecily's name and personality - and also her sister's name
    - Mabye last name is Brewer?
- [IDEA] idea of Burt needing to learn some lessons in love (a-la Tiffany Aching / Harry & Cho Chang)

- Nana looks for signs of Willie in her first child and then in her grandchild but not till Burt
- Burt's mother passes soon after giving birth to him
- Burt's father perhaps never forgives this - and is also a bit ambitious
- Is short with Burt (dyslexia and left-handed)

- Nana takes Burt under her wing at a young age; reading & baking lessons
- Nana passes when Burt is 9; he is inconsolable for weeks
- Burt has a happy-go-lucky baker at age 22
- Mad crush on Cecily's sister - but seems to think about Cecily a lot more (though not aware)
- Needs to find his way and do some growing up

    Nana & Burt:
        Nana recognized Burt's true heritage from a very young age
        Burt was dyslexic and never took to copying. 
        Over his parent's objections, Nana supported Burt's inclination to bake and taught him skills
    Burt Today (goals and love interests and such):
        Burt is a lovable mess of unfulfilled potential
        He has a starry-eyed crush on Cecily's pretty older sister but in reality relates much better to Cecily
        He has a low opinion of himself due to his bad handwriting and not meeting parent's expectations
        He will need to learn more from the princess on both these fronts
        Burt is naturally good with his hands and loves the outdoors (vs. the confines of the coppiest chamber)
        Burt (when not brawling) gets along well with others and is affible and easy going; not stuck up
        Burt's father (Thomas) is a 3rd generation coppiest and dreams that in 1 or 2 more gens one of his offspring will achieve the title of scribe! And perhaps in many years to come, a scrivener!! (/sarcasm)


*** DC2 Ideas ***

DC2 Ideas I'm not Ready to Reveal / Commit To:
- Princess Saffron is actually Tabitha, senior member of the Circle of Enchanters, in disguise
- Tabitha is a member of the Enchanter's Circle and the real brains / pragmatist behind it (not Belboz)
- The real Princess Tabitha died from illness in childhood but her heartbroken parents couldn't face announcing
- Tabitha was visiting when the Steward's messenger arrived and substitued herself for the Princess
- Burt travels back in time to save Princess Saffron (and hopes to get a date with her)
- In truth, Burt is really destined for Cecily - but he needs some lessons in romance first
- These he'll get from Tabitha - who ends up liking Burt - but isn't a perfect match - and has obligations
- After failed summons Tabitha must leave - she knows the Enchanter Prophesy and must warn the circle about Krill
- (the idea being that Krill's evil plans are revealed in DC2)
- Alas, magic ends just when Tabitha, at long last, returns to right the darkness of Dark Castle
- The novice enchanter who saves the day in Enchanter is a minor non-descript character in DC2
- At the end of DC2, Burt suggests the novice to Tabitha and offers up the jug and bread to help them
- Burt: "Also, won't they need a way to get in the front gate?"; Tabitha "<curses> - I'll see to it"


*** Game Update Ideas ***

Key Prop / Backstory Ideas:
- Should intro game with a bit of backstory on Burt
- Biscuits:
    - The Family Tree insignia and the biscuit insignia are the same (except the biscuits are missing the RH)
    - Key opportunity to provide some early backstory
- The Elven Sword and the Brass Lantern (found on the wooden shelf) are relics from his adventuring days
    - They are handed down to Burt over the course of the adventure
    - Runes on sword should be eleven
    - Description should match Zork for both (except for battery power on Lantern)
    - Sword should glow in presence of danger
- Burt's Earthen Jug and Loaf of Bread are given to Tabitha at the end of DC2 and become the tools of Enchanter
    - Should match description in Enchanter
    - There's nothing at all special about this Earthen Jug. It's not at all like any other jug you may have come across anywhere else...
- have Cecily and Nana be occasional voices in Burt's head?
