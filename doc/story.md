'hedgehog_broach':
    "The silver Hedgehog Broach is about an inch in diameter and is carved with the crest of a hedgehog bearing a sword and a key. It's strangely familiar... you've seen one just like it... long ago... examining the Hedgehog Broach up close triggers a long forgotten memory...
    
    you were only five or six years old... you and all your family were at the bedside of your great grandmother, Nana Baker. She was old - very, very old - so old no even was sure how old - not even Nana. She'd been unable to eat or get out of bed for the past week and the village healer had given his solemn verdict that at long last her time had come. The whole village had come round to pay their last respects but now it was just family left. She looked very tired and her eyes were closed.
    
    'Thomas', said Nana, meaning your father, 'I'm weary... be a good lad and go heat me some tea... Nice and hot please.'. Next she sent your mother off for a special pillow she'd loaned to a friend. Soon every member of the family was off on an errand and it was just you and Nana.
    
    Quite suddenly, Nana's eyes opened, bright blue and wide awake. 'Well, Burty, finally we can have a little chat. I wish you were a bit older but now will have to do. Tell me Burty, how do ya feel about baking biscuits?'
    
    'It's na so bad' you'd stammered back.
    
    Nana laughed and gave you a warm smile. 'Don't feel bad Burty, I wasn't much of a Baker myself - had a bit of a wild romantic streak in me - just like you. You remind me so much of my Willy... and that's not entirely an accident mind you. Thought I might see a resemblance in your grandfather or father but they were mindful lads and happy enough to be Bakers. I guess it's waited for you to show itself. Probably just as well.'
    
    'Ah Willy... now don't get me wrong, Papa Baker was a good man - hard working and with a kind heart - took me hand when many others wouldn't have and always treated me good. But you're from different stock Burty, very different. And that comes with some responsibilities... you've got a destiny 'afore you and that can be hard on young man with no expecting of it. That's why I'm telling you this now.'
    
    'Your real great grandpa was Willy... William Herbert... last of the line of Flatheads... or so everyone's been told. He was a handsome man... like you Burty. And unlike the rest of his family - full of romance and laughter and travel and adventure. Could be a bit reckless at times but he had a good heart. He proposed to me right proper he did... didn't really have to... he was so high up in society... and so much older too... but the moment I told him he dropped right to one knee and popped the question. Didn't care the least what people said! Swore we'd elope if the high priest wouldn't marry us... and he would have too!'\n\n'Alas, that crazy man... four months before the big day he was wandering about the castle entrance, wearing his bathrobe and Royal Crown, smoking his pipe and reading a book as he walked, as usual, and boom, he trips on the drawbridge and falls right into the Moat! Eaten right up in one big bite by one of those mean old crocodiles that have swum in it forever. Oh the day I heard the news...' And with these words she touched the Hedgehog Broach she always wore over her heart. 'It was a dark day Burty, a dark day for me an' for the castle and all the lands around.'
    
    'Someday Burty William Baker, someday you'll be King. And when you is, you be a good King... a kind and courageous and bold king... and when you is King don't ya be going walking off the edge of the drawbridge with no weapon in your hands and breaking young girl's hearts - you hear me?'
    
    Stunned by this strange tale you began to stammer an answer but just then your Father returned with the hot tea. With a wink just for you, Nana's eyes closed again and she sank back into the bed. Minutes later she was gone.
    
    For years and years you wondered what she was talking about and eventually you began to doubt the conversation had ever even happened. Over time it had faded completely... but here in Dark Castle, with the Hedgehog Broach before you, the memory is clear and real. Nana was buried with her beloved broach - she had insisted on it. This must have been a matching mate - presumably worn by Willy himself."

'family_tree':
    "It appears to show the family tree of the Flathead dynasty. Though generally agreed to have peaked (nadired?) during the reign of Dimwit Flathead and petered out shortly there-after during the inglorious rulership of Wurb Flathead, this Family Tree tells a different story. It claims that a remote uncle of Wurb continued the line for seven more generations and eventually ended with William 'The Wanderer' Flathead only a little over 100 years ago. The area below William is indistinct and feels incomplete.. as if there are details still waiting to be filled in.\n\nAt the very top of the Family Tree you see a royal crest. Oddly enough, it appears to be a Hedgehog bearing a Shiny Sword and a Silver Key."

'guard_goblin_shiny_sword_burt_*':
    "The Shiny Sword surges with power and lethal heft in your hand. A preternatural calm comes over you. You were born for this moment. Your raucous pub crawling days were a mere temporary distraction. You know in your bones that this primal showdown was meant to be and that, with the Shiny Sword at your command, you were meant to win it. Resolute, and with a confidence you have never even imagined having up until this very moment, you stride forward to meet your foe in battle."

'moat_get_crown_result':
    "With courage and boldness to spare you leap from the drawbridge into the murky waters of the Moat. A less resolute adventurer might have turned tail at the sight of the oncoming giant crocodile but not you Burt. Treading water with your feet you take a two-handed grip on your weapon and get ready to face your destiny. Just before reaching you the primitive reptile realizes that you are armed and ready to fight (crocs are famously near-sighted). In surprise and fear it belches up the contents of it's stomach - including the Royal Crown - and flees in fear. With a deft athleticism unlike anything you've ever displayed before today you stow your weapon, snag the Royal Crown before it sinkes, and in one smooth motion adroitly hoist yourself back onto the drawbridge one handed. The lads at the pub would fall over at the sight of your skill and courage! (though mind you, they fall over on a regular basis as it is)"

Story History:
    Originally, there was no backstory. Just an unlikely hero named Burt, who was a bit of an oaf but a likable one. Evntually, as I got to the final puzzle, I felt a need to explain why Burt was in any way destined to be king. Also, I needed to give a hint as to how players could get the royal_crown - and thus was born the extensive hedgehog_broach monlouge - which I ended up quite liking. 

    Soon after, I got player feedback that more hinting was needed regarding how to get the silver_key. This led to the creation of the family_tree in the throne_room. Since Zork and Enchanter were such a powerful influences on the game, I decided to set Dark Castle in the same universe and make Willie (the last king) a likable member of the Flathead dynasty. This in turn led to updating the glass_bottle of water to match the earthen_jug from Enchanter.

    With these updates in mind, several key passages, such as Burt's victory over the guard_goblin and his acquisition of the royal_crown, were updated to imply a bit of a destiny. 

    Also, over time, the backstory has evolved. Originally, as can be seen from the hedgehog_broach passage, I had intended Burt to be a reluctant Baker. Sort of cut out for bigger things but baking because he was born to it. But over time, I've come to have a real affection for Burt's baking background. So now I have the idea knocking around in my head that he got his baking skills from Nana (who actually taught him some baking as well) and his adverntureous streak from Willie.
    
    Also, unbidden, the idea for a seqel came to me (daunting, given how far I am from finishing the main work!) in which Burt goes back in time to save a princess (perhaps named Tabitha) from a foreign land who has somehow become imprissoned in Bright Castle after Willie's death and just before it's fall into Dark Castle (enabling a brief face-to-face with a much younger Nana who recognizes Burt from his biscuit insignia). The idea is that perhaps Burt has a bit of a crush on the princess - who in turn teaches Burt some important lessons and also by the by has the ability to change into a cat - but likely needs to go home to help her father to avoid any sort of fascile rescue-the-princess-to-get-marriage-reward ending.

    And finally, when building out a second mini-adventure to test the Cleesh Engine with, I invented Cecily (who maybe I will rename Tiffany after the heroine of Wee Free Men - or perhaps Catherine - after my youngest?), the bookish youngest daughter of the village pub owner - who was destined to be Burt's true love (after he learned some important life lessons from princess Tabitha). 
    
    So now there's a bit of a backstory - but it's rather sprawling and patchwork. And I have a lot of quiestions to answer. What local village profession / expectation is this supposed to be in contrast to? And for that matter, what exactly did happen to Bright Castle that brought it crashing into the disrepair of Dark Castle? And who exactly is Burt and what does he want? And if Nana really passed when Burt was 5 or 6, how much baking could she have taught him (maybe he was 8 or 9 instead?)?

Tactical Ideas:
    - IDEA: is Burt a true baker following in the footsteps of Nana? (lean this way)
    - IDEA: or is baking something he's not really cut out for?
    - IDEA: maybe Willy's middle name was Herbert?
    - IDEA: update lantern and sword to match Zork
    - IDEA: add loaf of bread from Enchanter

Updated Backstory Outline:
    Willie & Nana:
        An adventureous spirit and a beautiful, cozy-making baker born for each other
        Update Willie's middle name to Herbert (Burt's namesake)
        After Willie's passing, Nana took the hand of the castle copiest to avoid ruin
        Both escaped to the local village before the fall; Nana hid her baking skills to avoid recognition
    Bright Castle Becomes Dark Castle:
        Something about an evil prince and the transformation of minions into animals???
    Nana & Burt:
        Nana recognized Burt's true heritage from a very young age
        Burt was dyslexic and never took to coppying. 
        Over his parent's objections, Nana supported Burt's inclination to bake and taught him skills
    Burt Today (goals and love interests and such):
        Burt is a lovable mess of unfulfilled potential
        He has a starry-eyed crush on Cecily's pretty older sister but in reality relates much better to Cecily
        He has a low opinion of himself due to his bad handwriting and not meeting parent's expectations
        He will need to learn more from the princess on both these fronts
        Burt is naturally good with his hands and loves the outdoors (vs. the confines of the coppiest chamber)
        Burt (when not brawling) gets along well with others and is affible and easy going; not stuck up
        Burt's father (Thomas) is a 3rd generation coppiest and dreams that in 1 or 2 more gens one of his offspring will achieve the title of scribe! And perhaps in many years to come, a scrivener!! (/sarcasm)
    Reference Objects:
        earthen_jug
        fresh-baked_biscuit
        elven_sword
            need to fix those dwarven_runes; perhaps funny dyslexic read from Burt: "Woblin Gallaper"
            should glow near the goblin?
        loaf_of_bread
        brass_lantern (but maybe not battery powered? That's always bothered me)
    Minion opponents in Dark Castle - who and why?

    - Spellbreaker Review: https://www.filfre.net/2014/05/spellbreaker/
    - "The History of Zork" (300 pg pdf)


To Do:
    - I like the story of Burt, born to bake and adventure but trapped in coppiest expectations
    - I like the idea of Burt needing to learn some lessons in love (a-la Tiffany Aching / Harry & Cho Chang)
    - I need to fill out the Dark Castle disaster - what sort of human frailty / dire betrayal led to this?
    - I need to fill out Nana's tale
    - I need a bit more info on Tabitha's kingdom... how related to the kingdom of Bright Castle
    - I need to finalize on Cecily's name and personality - and also her sister's name
        - have Cecily and Nana be occasional voices in Burt's head?


Rough Notes / Ideas:
- Krill (the evil Warlock from Enchanter) is the ultimate source of Dark Castle's ruin
- Willie is the Adventure from Zork I! 
- Tabitha is a member of the Enchanter's Circle and the real brains / pragmatist behind it (not Belboz)
- This is why Tabitha must leave - she knows the Prophesy and must warn the circle about Krill
- (the idea being that Krill's evil plans are revealed in DC2)
- Alas, magic ends just when Tabitha, at long last, returns to right the darkness of Dark Castle


Key Prop Ideas:
- Should intro game with a bit of backstory on Burt
- Biscuits:
    - The Family Tree insignia and the biscuit insignia are the same (except the biscuits are missing the RH)
    - Key opportunity to provide some early backstory
- The Elven Sword and the Brass Lantern (found on the wooden shelf) are relics from his adventuring days
    - They are handed down to Burt over the course of the adventure
    - Runes on sword should be eleven
    - Description should match Zork for both (except for battery power on Lantern)
    - Sword should glow in presence of danger
- Burt's Earthen Jug and Loaf of Bread are given to Tabitha at the end of DC2 and become the tools of Enchanter
    - Should match description in Enchanter

To Do: Details on Krill's evil plans
- Starting Ideas:
    - Willie dies via genunie accident but the power vacuum tempts Krill, previously in hiding, into acquisition
    - Some incompetent minion is tempted by jealousy / desire / averice / venality and, behind the scenes, is corrupted by Krill
    - The minion uses dark magic (provided by Krill) to corrupt the castle and transform inhabitants into animals
    - Durring DC2, Krill is revealed as the source of the corruption and the minion is deposed...,
    - But the curse is not reversed (due to Krill still being in power, etc)
- TBD: Need a poetic tragedy; character details; guard goblin as ultimate "local" villain?


To Do: Detail on Nana's and Thomas' flight from Dark Castle:
    - To Do: name of village? Details of events?
